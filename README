# https://hammondkd.github.io

This site is my faculty profile for my work at the University of Missouri.
I used to have sites at
  http://engineers.missouri.edu/hammondk
and later
  http://faculty.missouri.edu/hammondkd
but both of those servers got decommissioned. I used a site at
  https://hammondkd.mufaculty.umsystem.edu
for a while (hosted through Google sites), but I so detested how Google Sites
worked, I took that one back down again and made this one.
