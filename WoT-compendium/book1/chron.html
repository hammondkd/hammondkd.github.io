      p. ix (x)&mdash;The <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>,
      <a href="#Morning">Lord of the Morning</a>,
      <a href="#Kinslayer">Kinslayer</a>, Breaker of the
      World.  He is a tall man just into his middle years.
      He was handsome once, but now he has more white hair than brown,
      and his face is lined from strain and worry.  He has dark eyes.
      Known as the Dragon during the War of the Shadow.
      He killed his entire family in the madness that seized him
      after resealing the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>&rsquo;s prison.

      p. ix (x)&mdash;Wife of <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>.  She has
      blonde hair.  She was called &quot;Sunhair.&quot;  She died along with
      her children when her insane husband killed them, and her.

      p. x&mdash;Source
      of all evil, antithesis of the <a href="#Creator">Creator</a>.  He was
      imprisoned by the Creator at the moment of Creation at Shayol Ghul.
      This prison was bored into during the Age of Legends, which led to the
      War of the Shadow, the Time of Madness, the Breaking of the World, and
      the end of the Age of Legends.  Since naming him by his true name brings
      ill fortune or disaster, many euphemisms exist, including Father of
      Lies, Grassburner, Heartsbane, Heartfang, Leafblighter, Lord of the
      Grave, Shepherd of the Night, Sightblinder, and Soulsbane.  He is most
      commonly referred to as simply &ldquo;The Dark One.&rdquo;

      p. x (xi)&mdash;Man who appears to <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a> shortly
      after he killed his entire family.  He Healed Lews Therin from his
      madness, allowing him to finally realize what he had done.  Elan Morin
      is now known as <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a>, which means
      &ldquo;<a href="#Betrayer">Betrayer of Hope</a>&rdquo; in the Old Tongue.
      He claims to follow a &ldquo;different power&rdquo; now, that of the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> himself.  He was once humbled by Lews
      Therin in the Hall of Servants, and defeated by him at the gates of
      Paaren Disen.  However, Lews Therin fled and killed himself before
      Elan Morin could do with him as he had planned.

      p. xi&mdash;Name given to <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>
      during the War of the Shadow.  He did not like the name.  The name is now
      associated with evil, since Lews Therin killed his entire family in his
      madness at the end of his life.  It is said the Dragon will be Reborn at
      mankind&rsquo;s greatest hour of need to save the world&mdash;and Break
      it again.

<img src="../chapters/ravens.gif" width="164" height="80" alt="Ravens icon">
  <li><a class="name" name="Egwene">Egwene al&rsquo;Vere</a>,
      p. 5 [1]&mdash;A nine-year-old girl from Emond&rsquo;s Field.
      She is the daughter of <a href="#Bran">Bran</a>, the Mayor
      of Emond&rsquo;s Field, and his wife <a href="#Marin">Marin</a>.
      Egwene has four older sisters;
      <a href="#Berowyn">Berowyn</a>,
      <a href="#Alene">Alene</a>,
      <a href="#Elisa">Elisa</a>, and
      <a href="#Loise">Loise</a>;
      and resents them at times for treating her as the baby of the family.
      Egwene dislikes dogs, and is not considered big for her age.
      She loves her village and its customs, but she is beginning to wonder
      what the world outside it is like.  After reaching the age of eighteen,
      Egwene earns the right to wear her hair in a braid for the first time,
      the Two Rivers symbol of womanhood.  She has large brown eyes.  She
      and <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> have been all but Promised to each other since
      she was nine; this makes him uncomfortable.  <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>
      discovered that Egwene has the ability to Listen to the Wind, a Talent
      that all Wisdoms claim to possess but few actually do.

      <a href="#Marin">al&rsquo;Vere, Marin</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Ahan">Kenley Ahan</a>,
      p. [2]&mdash;A boy from
      Emond&rsquo;s Field in the Two Rivers.  He is about two years older than
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>, making him eleven years old.
  <li><a class="name" name="Aynal">Widow Aynal</a>,
      p. [2]&mdash;Woman for which Widow Aynal&rsquo;s Meadow is named.  No one
       remembers which Aynal widow it was actually named for; the meadow has
       been called that as long as anyone can remember.
  <li><a class="name" name="Berowyn">Berowyn al&rsquo;Vere</a>,
      p. [3]&mdash;Oldest of
      the five daughters of <a href="#Bran">Bran</a> and
      <a href="#Marin">Marin al&rsquo;Vere</a>; <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>&rsquo;s
      oldest sister.  She has been allowed to wear her hair in a braid, the
      Two Rivers symbol of adulthood for women, since she was sixteen years
      old.  Berowyn was married, but her husband and her newborn child
      died in the epidemic of breakbone fever that struck the village;
      the same epidemic threatened Egwene&rsquo;s life as well. She has since
      treated Egwene as though she were Berowyn&rsquo;s own child,
      mooning over her as if she were the last thing left in her life.

  <li><a class="name" name="Ewin">Ewin Finngar</a>,
      p. 18 [4] (19)&mdash;Boy from
      Emond&rsquo;s Field.  He is very young&mdash;seven or eight years
      old&mdash;but he already has a reputation for filching sweets when no
      one is looking.  He is about six years younger than <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Corin">Corin Ayellin</a>,
      p. 36 [4] (38)&mdash;Slim woman from Emond&rsquo;s Field.  She has a thick gray braid
      that hangs down as far as her hips.  She bakes the best sweets in
      Emond&rsquo;s Field, possibly in the Two Rivers&mdash;<a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>
      asserts that her own mother&rsquo;s are better, but even her mother
      admits that Mistress Ayellin&rsquo;s are the best.

      <a href="#Dav">Ayellin, Dav</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>,
      p. 4 [4] (5)&mdash;A boy of about thirteen years of age from Emond&rsquo;s field.
      He is one of the tallest boys in Emond&rsquo;s Field,
      even taller than <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>, one of his two best friends
      (though since Rand is not yet finished growing, it is possible he will
      catch Perrin eventually).
      He is also good friends with <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>, who often
      gets Perrin and Rand into trouble.
      He has curly hair, and is very stocky and generally big.
      He is very shy and laughs seldomly; <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>
      perceives him to be dense, though she is starting to realize he may
      simply be overly contemplative and careful.
      His parents recently arranged to have him apprenticed to
      <a href="#Luhhan">Haral Luhhan</a>, the blacksmith of Emond&rsquo;s Field.
      Perrin has two younger sisters, <a href="#Adora">Adora</a> and
      <a href="#Deselle">Deselle</a> (eight and three, respectively) and one
      younger brother, <a href="#Paetram">Paetram</a>, who is an infant.
      As an adult, Perrin ended up about half a head shorter than Rand, and
      also a fair bit shorter than Mat as well.  He is still larger of build
      than both of them, however, which works well for a blacksmith.

  <li><a class="name" name="Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a>,
      p. 1 [4]&mdash;Shepherd from the Two Rivers.
      He is the second tallest boy in Emond&rsquo;s Field, and may
      soon be taller than his friend <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a> as well.
      He has grey eyes and reddish hair, both of which are unheard of in the
      Two Rivers.  His mother died when Rand was five;
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> thinks he envies boys that have mothers.
      Rand is good friends with <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>
      and <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>.
      As a twenty year-old, Rand is about a head taller than Perrin,
      and taller than Mat as well.  Rand and the Mayor&rsquo;s daughter,
      Egwene, have been all but Promised to each other since they were both
      young; this is often the subject of ridicule by Mat and Perrin.

      She seemed upset that her mother and father were detaining her at the
      forge when she could have been playing with her friends&mdash;she will
      not be asked to carry water for another year.  She tells
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>, &ldquo;everybody says she&rsquo;ll marry
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a>&rdquo;; Egwene was aware that her

      men&rsquo;s legs, and his chest strains his shirt.  He is the tallest man
      in the Two Rivers.  Master Luhhan has recently aquired a new apprentice
      in <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>.  His wife, <a href="#Alsbet">Alsbet</a>, is

      considers her a &ldquo;ninny.&rdquo;  She likes to stare and make

  <li><a class="name" name="Mat">Matrim (Mat)  Cauthon</a>,
      p. 4 [6] (5)&mdash;Boy of
      about 13 years of age from Emond&rsquo;s Field.  He has brown eyes.
      Mat is known for his practical jokes and other mischief,
      often getting his best friends in trouble with him.
      He is good friends with <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a> and
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>, though he seems to have a contest
      going with <a href="#Dav">Dav Ayellin</a> as to who can get the other
      into the most trouble.  He has two younger sisters,
      <a href="#Bode">Bodewhin</a> and <a href="#Eldrin">Eldrin</a>.
      As a twenty year-old, Mat has grown to be one of the tallest men in
      the Two Rivers.  He is still known for his practical jokes and other

  <li><a class="name" name="Barran">Doral Barran</a>,
      p. 268 [7] (285)&mdash;Wisdom of Emond&rsquo;s Field.  She is the oldest woman in
      Emond&rsquo; Field, possibly in the entire Two Rivers.
      She is white-haired and frail, though still
      clear-eyed and not stooped at all.  Her last apprentice died of a
      mysterious illness that she could not cure.  She currently has another
      apprentice, <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara</a>, who has been
      studying under her for three years.

  <li><a class="name" name="Nynaeve">Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara</a>,
      p. 7 [7]&mdash;Young woman from Emond&rsquo;s Field.  She has brown hair and
      eyes, and is quite slender.  She has been studying under
      <a href="#Barran">Doral Barran</a>, the Wisdom of Emond&rsquo;s Field, for
      about three years.  Many people in the village think she is too young to
      be apprenticed to a Wisdom, and that Mistress Barran should have chosen
      someone years older when Nynaeve&rsquo;s predecessor died mysteriously.
      Nynaeve is a very quick learner, and has been allowed to braid her hair
      for a year now.  She has developed the ability to sense
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>&rsquo;s presence without seeing her since the end of
      the breakbone fever epidemic.  Mistress Barran seems to have caught on to
      some of Nynaeve&rsquo;s abilities&mdash;she seemed disappointed that the
      wound Nynaeve was bandaging did not seem more healed than it was when she
      started.  After Mistress Barran&rsquo;s death, Nynaeve herself became the
      Wisdom.  Her adult height is about as tall as <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>&rsquo;s
      shoulder.  Many people <i>still</i> think Nynaeve is too young to be the
      Wisdom; however, mentioning this to her is a good way to get whacked by
      the stick she carries.
  <li><a class="name" name="Bili">Bili Congar</a>,
      p. 34 [7] (36)&mdash;A man from
      Emond&rsquo;s Field.  According to <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>, he is
      always doing stupid things and always getting hurt.  She has very
      little, if any, respect for him.  He is of an age with
      <a href="#Luhhan">Haral Luhhan</a>, but he <i>looks</i> as though he is
      about ten years older due to his hollow cheeks and sunken eyes.
      Egwene encountered him with the Wisdom after he sliced open his leg due
      to being drunk while trying to shear sheep.
      It is later revealed that he does not believe in the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>, Darkfriends, Aes Sedai, or any of the
      other stories.  He once <i>named</i> the Dark One, but when ill fortune
      struck his crops for months afterwards, he scowled at anyone (such as
      <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>) who attempted to get him to do so again.

      to her waist, tied with a blue kerchief&mdash;the Women&rsquo;s Circle
      has not yet granted her the privilege of wearing it braided.
      She is one year older than <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>.
      She is very fond of quotations; Egwene finds in annoying when they get
      stuck in her head.

      almost twenty-one, though she still has not been granted the privilege of
      wearing her hair in a braid, the symbol of womanhood in Emond&rsquo;s
      Field.  She enjoys flirting, and does not seem to be bothered by the fact

      and Emond&rsquo;s Field.  <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> thinks his ears look
      funny, but many of the other girls in the village think Wil is quite
      pretty.  As a teen, he always had girls staring at him and whispering
      behind his back.  He courted every girl, and managed to convince all of
      them that he was just being polite to the others.
  <li><a class="name" name="Paet">Paet al&rsquo;Caar</a>,

      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> brought the Trollocs to Emond&rsquo;s Field on
      Winternight.  His son, <a href="#Wil">Wil</a>, had his leg broken in that attack
      and was Healed by <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>, so Paet was less fervent in his

        that stood up in the back. A nine-year-old <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>

      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>.  He has a large girth,
      about double of anyone else, and a fringe of thinning gray hair.
      He is known around town as being very stubborn,
      and not someone to be trifled with.

      someone with a son like Mat.  She always seems to know about Mat&rsquo;s
      escapades; Mat is not sure how she always knows, but it is obvious to

      He has a thick, broad chest and a broad face, gray hair with black
      streaks in it.  His cheeks have been roughened by the sun.  He is a
      solid man.  Keeping his word is important to him.  When Tam was young,
      he left the Two Rivers to see the outside world, something which is
      extremely rare in the Two Rivers.  While there he acquired a sword, and
      married <a href="#Kari">Kari</a>, a woman from Caemlyn.  Since Kari&rsquo;s
      death fifteen years ago, Tam has raised Rand himself.  Since Tam has
      been alone and without a wife for so long, many women in Emond&rsquo;
      Field have been trying to find a match for him recently.  They&rsquo;ve also
      started to think about who would be good for his son as well.  Tam is
      very quiet, and keeps largely to himself, but almost everyone in the Two
      Rivers likes him.

      uncle.  He was married to <a href="#Breyan">Breyan</a>.  His brother and
      he were as close as twins, and never let even Akir&rsquo;s becoming king
      get in the way.  His wife, however, was jealous of Akir, and dared her
      husband to march his men all the way to Shayol Ghul itself, hoping to
      use the inevitable defeat as cause to pull Akir off the throne.  Lain
      died in the Blasted Lands.

      Shayol Ghul itself.  When they were defeated, she attempted to frame

      <a href="#Cowin">Cowin Fairheart</a> to attempt to seize the throne of
      Malkier for her son, <a href="#Isam">Isam</a>.  Breyan fled Malkier when
      it fell to the Shadow, disappeared with Isam into the Blight, and was

      way on the council, he would have been.
      Unknown to everyone until shortly
      before the fall of Malkier, he was a Darkfriend.  When they found out,
      many called for his head on a pike, but as he was so close to the king,

      <a href="#Akir">Akir</a>.  Also called Cowin Fairheart.
