  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Adora">Adora Aybara</A>,
      p. 4&mdash;<A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A>'s eight-year-old sister.
      She seemed upset that her mother and father were detaining her at the
      forge when she could have been playing with her friends&mdash;she will
      not be asked to carry water for another year.  She tells
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>, &ldquo;everybody says she'll marry
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>&rdquo;; Egwene was aware that her
      parents and perhaps Rand's father thought this, but not that
      <I>everyone</I> thought so&hellip;.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alene">Alene al'Vere</A>, p. 7&mdash;Second oldest
      of five daughters of <A Href="#Marin">Marin</A> and <A Href="#Bran">Bran
      al'Vere</A> of Emond's Field.  She loves to read, and ignores
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> unless Egwene is presently reading a book
      that she herself wants to read&mdash;in this case, she usually takes it
      and proclaims it to be much too &ldquo;complex&rdquo; for Egwene to
      understand.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</A>, p. 15&mdash;Hero of
      Legend who ruled all the lands from the Aiel Waste to the Aryth Ocean
      and beyond.  He even sent troops across the Aryth Ocean,
      as well as to the lands beyond the Aiel Waste.
      His death set off the War of the Hundred Years.
      During <A Href="#Tam">Tam</A>'s story, he tells the boys that the
      battles during Hawkwing's time, which involved hundreds of thousands,
      were mere skirmishes compared to the devastation wrought by the
      War of the Shadow.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Bandry">Bandry (Ban) Crawe</A>, p. 10&mdash;Young
      man from Emond's Field.  He is about ten months older
      than <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Berowyn">Berowyn al'Vere</A>, p. 3&mdash;Oldest of
      the five daughters of <A Href="#Bran">Bran</A> and
      <A Href="#Marin">Marin al'Vere</A>; <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>'s
      oldest sister.  She has been allowed to wear her hair in a braid, the
      Two Rivers symbol of adulthood for women, since she was sixteen years
      old.  Berowyn was married, but her husband and her newborn child
      died in the epidemic of breakbone fever that struck the village;
      the same epidemic threatened Egwene's life as well.
      She has since treated Egwene as though she were Berowyn's own child,
      mooning over her as if she were the last thing left in her life.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Bili">Bili Congar</A>, p. 7&mdash;A man from
      Emond's Field.  According to <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>, he is
      always doing stupid things and always getting hurt.  She has very
      little, if any, respect for him.  He is of an age with
      <A Href="#Haral">Haral Luhhan</A>, but he <I>looks</I> as though he is
      about ten years older due to his hollow cheeks and sunken eyes.
      Egwene encountered him with the Wisdom after he sliced open his leg due
      to being drunk while trying to shear sheep.  Egwene does not respect him
      at all.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="alDai">Bili al'Dai</A>, p. 14&mdash;Young man from
      Emond's Field.  He is <A Href="#MralDai">Master al'Dai</A>'s grandson.

      mischief (which is quite often).

      Winespring Inn.  He is the father of five girls, including
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>.  He has a large girth,
      about double of anyone else, and a fringe of thinning gray hair.
      He is known around town as being very stubborn,
      and not someone to be trifled with.  <I>See also</I>

<H2><A Name="C">C</A></H2>
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Calle">Calle Coplin</A>, p. 8&mdash;Young woman
      from Emond's Field.  She is twenty years old, almost twenty-one, though
      she still has not been granted the privilege of wearing her hair in a
      braid, the symbol of womanhood in Emond's Field.  She enjoys flirting,
      and does not seem to be bothered by the fact that many girls as many as
      four years her junior are considered grown women while she is not.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Cenn">Cenn Buie</A>, p. 13&mdash;Thatcher in
      Emond's Field.  He is gnarled but spry, and speaks with a raspy voice.
      He sits on the Village Council, but is probably the most disagreeable
      member on it.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Cilia">Cilia Cole</A>, p. 5&mdash;Pink-cheeked
      girl of eleven from Emond's Field.  <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>
      considers her a &ldquo;ninny.&rdquo;  She likes to stare and make
      calf-eyes at <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A>; Egwene thinks Perrin at least
      ought to <I>notice</I> her attentions.  <I>We find out later, of course,
      that Cilia eventually gave Perrin his first kiss.</I>
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Con">Con Aybara</A>, p. 5&mdash;Father of
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A>, <A Href="#Adora">Adora</A>,
      <A Href="#Deselle">Deselle</A>, and <A Href="#Paetram">Paetram</A> and

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Corin">Corin Ayellin</A>, p. 4&mdash;Slim woman
      from Emond's Field.  She has a thick gray braid that hangs down as far
      as her hips.  She bakes the best sweets in Emond's Field, possibly in
      the Two Rivers&mdash;<A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> asserts that her own
      mother's are better, but even her mother admits that Mistress Ayellin's
      are the best.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Creator">Creator</A>, p. 15&mdash;Maker of
      everything in existence.  At
      the moment of Creation, the Creator sealed the <A Href="#Dark">Dark
      One</A> in a prison to keep him from influencing the world.
</Ol>

<H2><A Name="D">D</A></H2>
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Dag">Dag Coplin</A>, p. 6&mdash;Old man from
      Emond's Field.  His hair is gray, and is not washed all that often, if
      at all.  His skin is very wrinkled with age.
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> only calls him &ldquo;Master Coplin&rdquo;
      in public, to be polite&mdash;in her own head, he is simply Dag Coplin,
      with no further respect involved.
      <I>Not to be confused with his grandson, who has the same name.</I>
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Dannil">Dannil Lewin</A>, p. 12&mdash;Boy from
      Emond's Field.  He is thirteen years old, even skinnier than
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>, and has a thrusting nose.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Dark">Dark One</A>, p. 1&mdash;Source
      of all evil, antithesis of the <A Href="#Creator">Creator</A>.  He was
      imprisoned by the Creator at the moment of Creation at Shayol Ghul.
      This prison was bored into during the Age of Legends, which led to the
      War of the Shadow, the Time of Madness, the Breaking of the World, and
      the end of the Age of Legends.  Since naming him by his true name brings
      ill fortune or disaster, many euphemisms exist, including Father of
      Lies, Grassburner, Heartsbane, Heartfang, Leafblighter, Lord of the
      Grave, Shepherd of the Night, Sightblinder, and Soulsbane.  He is most
      commonly referred to as simply &ldquo;The Dark One.&rdquo;
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Dav">Dav Ayellin</A>, p. 10&mdash;Boy from
      Emond's Field, of an age with <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>.
      He and Mat are friends, and like to get into mischief together.
      In fact, he and Mat seem to have a competition over who can get into
      the most trouble.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Deselle">Deselle Aybara</A>,
      p. 4&mdash;<A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A>'s three-year-old sister.
      She enjoys &ldquo;flying&rdquo; (Perrin holding her arms and spinning
      her until her feet leave the ground).

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Barran">Doral Barran</A>, p. 7&mdash;Wisdom of
      Emond's Field.  She is the oldest woman in Emond's Field, possibly in
      the entire Two Rivers.  She is white-haired and frail, though still
      clear-eyed and not stooped at all.  Her last apprentice died of a
      mysterious illness that she could not cure.  She currently has another
      apprentice, <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</A>, who has been
      studying under her for three years.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A>, p. 1&mdash;A
      nine-year-old girl from Emond's Field.
      She is the daughter of <A Href="#Bran">Bran</A>, the Mayor
      of Emond's Field, and his wife <A Href="#Marin">Marin</A>.
      This was the first year she was allowed to carry water for Emond's
      Field's sheep shearing, and she intends to do the job better than
      anyone else.  Egwene has four older sisters;
      <A Href="#Berowyn">Berowyn</A>,
      <A Href="#Alene">Alene</A>,
      <A Href="#Elisa">Elisa</A>, and
      <A Href="#Loise">Loise</A>;
      and resents them at times for treating her as the baby of the family.
      Egwene dislikes dogs, and is not considered big for her age.
      She loves her village and its customs, but she is beginning to wonder
      what the world outside it is like.

      al'Vere</A> of Emond's Field.  She is eighteen.  She wears her hair

      yet granted her the privilege of wearing it braided.
      She is one year older than <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>.
      She is very fond of quotations; Egwene finds in annoying when they get

      strains his shirt.  He is the tallest man in the Two Rivers.
      Master Luhhan has recently aquired a new apprentice in

      grandfather.  Despite his advanced years, his eyes remain clear and
      sharp, as does his mind.  He is also quite quick with the shears, almost
      as fast as <A Href="#Tam">Tam al'Thor</A> and faster than everyone else.

      Mat is known for his practical jokes and other mischief,
      often getting his best friends in trouble with him.
      He is good friends with <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> and
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A>, though he seems to have a contest
      going with <A Href="#Dav">Dav Ayellin</A> as to who can get the other
      into the most trouble.  He has two younger sisters,

      Emond's Field, mother of <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>.  She is always calm and
      collected, which <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> figures is necessary for
      someone with a son like Mat.  She always seems to know about Mat's
      escapades; Mat is not sure how she always knows, but it is obvious to
      Egwene that his two younger sisters enjoy the role of tattletale.

      woman from Emond's Field.  She has brown hair and eyes, and is quite
      slender.  She has been studying under <A Href="#Barran">Doral Barran</A>,
      the Wisdom of Emond's Field, for about three years.  Many people in the
      village think she is too young to be apprenticed to a Wisdom, and that
      Mistress Barran should have chosen someone years older when Nynaeve's
      predecessor died mysteriously.  Nynaeve is a very quick learner, and
      has been allowed to braid her hair for a year now.  She has developed
      the ability to sense <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>'s presence without
      seeing her since the end of the breakbone fever epidemic.  Mistress
      Barran seems to have caught on to some of Nynaeve's abilities&mdash;she
      seemed disappointed that the wound Nynaeve was bandaging did not seem
      more healed than it was when she started.

      about thirteen years of age from Emond's field.
      He is one of the tallest boys in Emond's Field,
      even taller than <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>, one of his two best friends
      (though since Rand is not yet finished growing, it is possible he will
      catch Perrin eventually).
      He is also good friends with <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A>, who often
      gets Perrin and Rand into trouble.
      He has curly hair, and is very stocky and generally big.
      He is very shy and laughs seldomly; <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>
      perceives him to be dense, though she is starting to realize he may
      simply be overly contemplative and careful.
      His parents recently arranged to have him apprenticed to
      <A Href="#Haral">Haral Luhhan</A>, the blacksmith of Emond's Field.
      Perrin has two younger sisters, <A Href="#Adora">Adora</A> and
      <A Href="#Deselle">Deselle</A> (eight and three, respectively) and one
      younger brother, <A Href="#Paetram">Paetram</A>, who is an infant.

      He has grey eyes and reddish hair, both of which are unheard of in the
      Two Rivers.  His mother died when Rand was five;
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> thinks he envies boys that have mothers.

      He is a solid man.
      Tam is very quiet, and keeps largely to himself, but almost everyone in
