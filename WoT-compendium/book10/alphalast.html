  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Logain">Ablar, Logain</A>, p. 31&mdash;False      <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A> who created war in Ghealdan and surrounding
      nations before being captured and gentled by the Red Ajah.  He got loose
      during the chaos surrounding the deposing of <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan
      Sanche</A>, and eventually was escorted out of Tar Valon by Siuan and
      her traveling companions.  Before he was gentled he was of considerable
      strength, and attracted quite a following of loyal soldiers.
      <A Href="#Min">Min</A> still has viewings of him with a halo over his
      head, which she thinks indicates that he will become a figure of great
      power sometime in the future.  Recently, Logain later came forward with
      information that indicated that the Red Ajah actually put him up to
      declaring himself the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>, most likely
      with the pretext that bringing down a false Dragon would bring more glory
      than gentling a simple man who could channel.  Logain was recently Healed
      by <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>, and was let free by
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> to do as he pleased.  He chose to go to
      the Black Tower, and now leads a part of the Asha'man that seem to be
      discontent with <A Href="#Taim">Taim</A>'s leadership.  When Aes Sedai
      came to the Black Tower to attempted to capture the Asha'man (not
      realizing their numbers), Logain bonded two sisters to him as
      &quot;wives&quot; using the &quot;wife bond&quot; that the Asha'man
      developed, <A Href="#Toveine">Toveine Gazal</A> of the Red Ajah and
      <A Href="#Gabrelle">Gabrelle</A> of the Brown Ajah.  He has curly black
      hair and broad shoulders.  <I>See also</I>

      front of him.  He is tall, though still two hands shorter than
      <A Href="#Bael">Bael</A>, and has a thick black beard.  Bashere is
      grooming him for a higher rank.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aiden">Aiden</A>, p. 504&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Brown
      Ajah, and one of the Tower librarians.  She is even darker than

      from the Sea Folk.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Ailron">Ailron</A>, p. 28&mdash;King of Amadicia until
      the Seanchan invaded.  He was not as strong as most kings due to the
      control of the Children of the Light&mdash;in fact, he had almost no real
      power at all.  During the invasion, he took his army to engage the
      invaders near Jeramel; they were slaughtered, and Ailron himself was
      captured in what <A Href="#Valda">Valda</A> now calls &ldquo;Ailron's
      Disaster.&rdquo;  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Niall">Niall, Pedron</A>;

      of killing rats with his knife.

      the Brown Ajah.  She was convinced that <A Href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</A>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Lelaine">Akashi, Lelaine</A>, p. 404&mdash;Slender      Sitter for the Blue Ajah in Salidar.  She carries a dignified air about

      leads one of two factions that divides the Hall of the Tower under

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Turak">Aladon, Turak</A>, p. 160&mdash;High Lord of
      Seanchan and commander of the Forerunners before his death in Falme.  He
      was killed there when <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> bested him in a
      swordfight.  He was a Blademaster, and was quite stunned when Rand was
      able to match him.  He kept a collection of rare <I>cuendillar</I>
      objects, including (thanks in part to looting <A Href="#Bayle">Bayle
      Domon</A>'s ship) two seals on the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>'s
      prison.  Both of these seals broke when the Seanchan were pushed back
      into the sea at Falme.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alivia">Alivia</A>, p. 538&mdash;Seanchan
      <I>damane</I> captured by Asha'man.  She was afraid of freedom because
      she feared being captured again.  She has been collared since she was
      thirteen or fourteen, and has been <I>damane</I> for over four hundred
      years.  She is considerably stronger in the One Power than
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>, and a little bit taller.  She has fine
      lines at the corners of her sharp blue eyes and white streaks in her
      blonde hair.  <A Href="#Min">Min</A> dislikes her, though not because of
      jealousy.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Zarya">Alkaese, Zarya</A>, p.      298&mdash;Real name of <A Href="#Garenia">Garenia</A>, the name

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Katerine">Alruddin, Katerine</A>, p. 56&mdash;Aes Sedai      of the Red Ajah.  Though she keeps it secret, she is actually of the
      Black Ajah, and has been for twelve years.  She was captured by
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> during the battle at Dumai's Wells, but escaped
      her captors, most likely with assistance from Darkfriends.  She has
      black hair.  She and <A Href="#Tarna">Tarna</A> took rooms in
      <A Href="#Burlow">Garon Burlow</A>'s house while the Younglings were
      there.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Sorelana">Alsahhan, Sorelana</A>, p.      208&mdash;Historian during the Trolloc Wars; she spoke of &ldquo;the
      hundred packs of the Shadow's hounds that hunt the night.&rdquo;
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alsalam">Alsalam</A>, p. 17&mdash;King of Arad
      Doman.  He has been a good ruler for over twenty years, though the
      Council has recently smuggled him out of Bandar Eban&mdash;after leaving
      the city, he seems to have taken on the notion that he is the Rebirth
      of <A Href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aludra">Aludra</A>, p. 120&mdash;Illuminator from
      Tarabon with dark waist-length hair done in thin braids, large dark
      eyes, and a plump mouth.  She was involved with the fireworks display
      for <A Href="#Galldrian">King Galldrian</A> of Cairhien that went awry
      when Trollocs came.  She was blamed for its failure, though she
      believed one of her colleagues, Tammuz, was to blame.  She was cast out
      of the Illuminators' Guild, and when she refused to stop practicing the
      art of making fireworks, several men tried to kill her.  She was saved
      by <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A> and <A Href="#Thom">Thom</A> in a barn, and as
      a sign of gratitude she gave Mat a roll of fireworks.  She later came to
      Ebou Dar, and asked Mat to find her a bellfounder.  He was knocked out
      during the battle and thus missed the bellfounder, but Aludra escaped
      and she now travles with Mat's entourage.  <I>Note:  it is widely
      speculated that Aludra is looking for a bellfounder for a specific
      reason:  she wants to build a cannon.</I>

      Ones.  The events following Dumai's Wells shook her so deeply that
      <A Href="#Cadsuane">Cadsuane</A> thinks she will never quite recover
      herself.  <A Href="#Min">Min</A> says that <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>
      should be able to trust her.  She is one of those now sworn to obey him.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Anaiya">Anaiya</A>, p. 398&mdash;Aes Sedai of the

      full sister.  She, like all Blues, fled the Tower when

      carries a position of considerable influence in the &quot;Little
      Tower&quot; in exile from Tar Valon.  She dresses very simply, and very

      in her hair.

      Morgase did long ago, for attempting to take the Lion Throne.  She still
      plans to take it from <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>, though once she was
      rescued from Murandy by <A Href="#Arymilla">Arymilla</A>'s men, her

      reign of <A Href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</A>.  Her strong spirit and
      sturdy administration brought the Tower back to most of its former
      prestige, all of which was teetering on the brink of disappearing after
      Bonwhin's manipulations of Hawkwing.  She in effect saved the Tower.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Saerin">Asnobar, Saerin</A>, p. 40&mdash;Sitter for the      Brown Ajah in Tar Valon for forty years.  She is from Altara.
      She carries a curved knife, in the
      fashion of her native Altara.  She has touches of white at her dark
      temples which emphasize a thin, age-faded white scar.  Only a Warder
      could match her for scowling.  She has held her chair in the Hall for
      forty years, and has worn the shawl for over 150.  Everyone knows to be
      wary of her temper.  She was born the daughter of an innkeeper, and was
      first trained by the Daughters of Silence (an organization similar to,
      but shorter-lived and smaller than, the Kin)&mdash;she was the only one of
      them to ever obtain the shawl.  She is good at taking charge of things,
      and immediately took charge of the organization to fetter out
      Darkfriends in the Tower with <A Href="#Pevara">Pevara</A>, dismissing
      <A Href="#Seaine">Seaine</A> from her position.  <I>See also</I>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Asunawa">Asunawa, Rhadam</A>, p. 29&mdash;Gray-haired,      bony-fingered High Inquisitor for the Hand of the Light.  He wants
      every woman affiliated in any way with the White Tower hanged as of
      yesterday, every book that mentions Aes Sedai or the White Tower burned,
      and the very words banned.  He would have
      <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A> hanged for her months in the Tower if

      <A Href="#Valda">Eamon Valda</A>'s killing of
      <A Href="#Omerna">Omerna</A> subsequent to Niall's murder.  He commands

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Shiaine">Avarhin, Shiaine</A>, p.      380&mdash;Darkfriend who previously worked for <A Href="#Carridin">Jaichim

      to kill <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A> when she found him and
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> in a shed on their way from Emond's Field to
      Fal Dara.  She gives orders to <A Href="#Hanlon">Daved Hanlon</A>.  She
      is very stingy, except with her own comforts.  She is pretty, and has a
      slim neck, glossy brown hair past her shoulders, brown eyes, and a smile
      that never touches them.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aviendha">Aviendha</A>, p. 270&mdash;Aiel of the Nine
      Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel.  Formerly a Maiden of the Spear, she
      was forced to give up the spear to become a Wise One because she had the
      ability to channel inborn.  She has green eyes, and is of age with
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> and <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>.  She is more than
      pretty with her dark reddish hair.  Aviendha is one of the three women
      in <A Href="#Min">Min</A>'s viewing of Rand&mdash;she also saw that she was
      to fall in love with him when she went through the three rings in
      Rhuidean.  She denied her feelings for him at first, but when the
      wagons crossed the Dragonwall toward Cairhien, sweat tents became
      unavailable and she tried bathing as &ldquo;wetlanders&rdquo; did; Rand
      came in as she was standing before the bath in her skin, and she
      panicked.  She created a Traveling gateway to northern Seanchan (she
      does not remember how), trying to get as far away from Rand as possible,
      into the middle of winter.  When Rand rescued her, she decided she could
      not hide her feelings any longer, and the two ended up spending the
      night in each other's arms before coming back.  Aviendha says a similar
      incident will not occur, and punished any Maiden who made a crack about
      it (how they found out about something that occurred on the far side of
      the world on another continent is a different subject entirely).  She
      felt <I>toh</I> toward <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> for violating her
      trust, but upon hearing that Elayne would consent to being her
      sister-wife, Aviendha felt empowered to show her feelings for Rand once
      again.  She is not certain what she thinks of a <I>second</I>
      sister-wife in Min, but she seems to accept the idea at least.  She has
      been having trouble learning Traveling again; the way Elayne forms the
      weave is different from how she used it to get to Seanchan, and it is
      difficult to learn something once you already learned it another way.
      She has, however, mastered the art of untying weaves&mdash;a feat which was
      thought impossible by all Aes Sedai, as well as the Forsaken.  She and
      Elayne have adopted each other as first-sisters.  Aviendha has a special
      ability in making wards against eavesdropping; it is unlikely even the
      Forsaken could breach one of her wards, and certainly no one could do so
      without her knowing it immediately.  <I>See also</I>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Perrin">Aybara, Perrin t'Bashere</A>, p.      152&mdash;Young man from Emond's Field.  He is <I>ta'veren</I>.  When
      he and <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> got separated from the rest of the
      group while fleeing the Trollocs on Winternight, Perrin met a man named
      <A Href="#Elyas">Elyas Machera</A>.  Elyas, a former Warder who found he
      could talk to wolves, helped Perrin discover the same ability in
      himself.  Perrin's eyes are now yellow, just like the wolves' eyes, and
      he can enter what he calls the Wolf Dream (known to most as
      <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>, the World of Dreams) with them.  Perrin is a
      childhood friend of fellow <I>ta'veren</I>
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> and <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A>.  On
      the way to Tear, Perrin encountered a young woman by the name of
      <A Href="#Zarine">Zarine Bashere</A>, a Hunter for the Horn who
      took the name of <A Href="#Faile">Faile</A> (which means
      &ldquo;Falcon&rdquo; in the Old Tongue) as a more appropriate name for a
      Hunter for the Horn.  The two are now married.  Perrin is a very large
      man&mdash;he was always a big person, which caused him to be very cautious
      since he found as a child that he could easily hurt other children if
      his temper got out of hand.  His size helps considerably when helping
      <A Href="#Haral">Master Luhhan</A> on his forge, but sometimes gives
      others the impression that he is slow and stupid.  He returned to the
      Two Rivers for a time to repel the series of Trolloc attacks; he and his
      wife are recognized as Lord and Lady there, the first noblility of the
      Two Rivers since the Trolloc Wars.  When he returned, he began to draw
      the eye of <A Href="#Berelain">Berelain sur Paendrag Paeron</A>, the
      First of Mayene&mdash;Perrin wants nothing more than to be as far from her as
      possible, but Berelain will not take no for an answer, much to Faile's
      dismay and intense jealousy.  Perrin was instrumental in freeing Rand
      from his entrapment at Dumai's Wells; the two had a fight afterwards
      (they had planned it as a way for Perrin to leave, although they most
      likely did not plan on it being as violent as it was), and Perrin went
      to Ghealdan to see if he could tame <A Href="#Masema">Masema</A>.  On
      the way, his wife was captured by Shaido, and now he must track her
      down.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Rand">al'Thor, Rand</A>;

      Vandene was too harsh toward her students.  She was considered one of

      of the Goshien Aiel; the two had to sneak through the camp of the other

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Bryne">Bryne, Gareth</A>, p. 330&mdash;Former First      Prince of the Sword and Captain of the Queen's Guards under
      <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A> in Andor.  He was appointed to the
      position because Morgase had no living male relatives, but was exiled
      from Caemlyn on a suggestion from Morgase's new advisor,
      <A Href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</A>.  He moved to his private estates in
      rural Andor, where he presided over the trial of three young women who
      unintentionally burned a barn: they turned out to be
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>, the former <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin
      Seat</A>; <A Href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</A>, the former
      <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A>, and
      <A Href="#Min">Min Farshaw</A>.  When these three made an oath to serve
      him and then apparently broke it, he followed them out of sheer
      curiosity to Salidar.  Once there, he discovered the true identity of
      the three, as well as that the Tower was truly broken.  The Aes Sedai in
      Salidar persuaded him to command the army they would need to take the
      Amyrlin Seat from <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>, since he was the only
      commander that the Warders thought would be willing and able to help
      them.  He is one of the six best military commanders west of the Aiel
      Waste, in a league with <A Href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</A>,
      <A Href="#Rodel">Rodel Ituralde</A>, <A Href="#Bashere">Davram
      Bashere</A>, <A Href="#Agelmar">Agelmar Jagad</A>, and
      <A Href="#Mat">Matrim Cauthon</A>.  Although neither of them would admit
      it, Bryne seems to be developing feelings for Siuan Sanche; he wishes to
      avoid another mistake like his relationship as
      <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A>'s lover, and also never forgave Siuan for
      when she publicly shamed him years ago.  She seems to be developing
      similar feelings for him, much to her dismay.  He planned to be the
      first general to take the city of Tar Valon; the closest anyone else
      ever came was with <A Href="#Guaire">Guaire Amalasan</A>'s armies, who
      got as far as the White Tower itself, and <A Href="#Hawkwing">Artur
      Hawkwing</A>, who never managed to go beyond beseiging the city.
      Actually, Amalasan's troops never beseiged the city, they simply managed
      to breech the walls; Hawkwing never managed to stop the supply ships
      coming up the river.  Bryne thought he will be able to overcome this
      problem by purchasing ships along the way to Tar Valon, but when
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> brought the entire army to Tar Valon by
      Traveling, that plan faltered; instead, he is pressuring her to let him
      use gateways to breach the walls and get inside the city.  He is stocky,
      with a bluff face.  The years have given him some sort of comforting
      calmness.  Men always follow him&mdash;they have learned from history that
      doing so is the path to military victory.  <I>See also</I>

      shielded.  She was captured by the Shaido after the battle at Dumai's

      friends, <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> and <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin
      Aybara</A>, he left home to escape the Trolloc attacks after
      Winternight.  On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger from Shadar
      Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which he carried
      with him for a long time.  He was separated from the dagger by Aes Sedai
      Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory sequence.  These
      gaps were filled and more when he passed through the twisted door to the
      land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three requests:  a foxhead
      medallion that protects him from women's channeling, a way out of the
      land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes that were the
      gaps in his memory.  Mat's <I>ta'veren</I> qualities manifest themselves
      particularly well with random events, such as dice games&mdash;he almost
      never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are weighted.  He has
      found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling, and along with his
      newfound memories he can win almost every battle he fights quite
      decisively.  He has four sisters, including <A Href="#Eldrin">Eldrin</A>
      and <A Href="#Bode">Bodewhin</A>, who are 17 and 16, respectively.  His
      father <A Href="#Abell">Abell</A> is one of the best archers in the Two
      Rivers, possibly in the World.  Mat has gotten in the habit of carrying
      concealed knives under his clothes in case he is attacked&mdash;his
      collection would surprise anyone.  In the Waste, he met a woman named
      Melindhra, a Maiden of the Spear from the Shaido Clan.  However, she was
      not the <A Href="#9Moons">Daughter of the Nine Moons</A>, who Mat is
      destined to marry according to the Aelfinn; besides, she tried to kill
      him on orders from her master among the Darkfriends.  Mat had to kill
      her to save his own skin, but regretted it deeply.  He also has a scar
      along his neck from where the Eelfinn tried to kill him&mdash;which was also
      in accordance with what the Aelfinn told him, that he is &quot;to die
      and live again.&quot;  He created an army called the Band of the Red
      Hand, after the army of <A Href="#Aemon">King Aemon</A> of old
      Manetheren, and served in a way as Rand's personal general&mdash;this worked
      well, since Mat seems to be a better general than even
      <A Href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</A>, who has earned his reputation as
      one of the best commanders alive.  Mat does not trust any Aes Sedai, and
      because of this refuses to take his foxhead medallion off even to take a
      bath.  Mat went to Ebou Dar to try to keep an eye on
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> and <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> and
      prevent them from getting themselves killed.  While there he was
      cornered by <A Href="#Tylin">Queen Tylin</A>, who gave him little choice
      but to become her lover.  When the Sea Folk and the Seanchan did battle
      in the city, he made his escape, leaving Tylin tied up under the bed so
      it looked &quot;official&quot;&mdash;Tylin was found torn limb from limb,
      obviously by the <I>gholam</I> which was no doubt sent to kill Mat.
      In the process of leaving, Mat also took several <I>sul'dam</I> and
      <I>damane</I> (who were subsequently freed from their collars), and even
      kidnapped <A Href="#Tuon">Tuon</A>, the <A Href="#9Moons">Daughter of

      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> and stilled both Siuan and Leane.  Her

      and speaks for the Amyrlin; she is all but separate from her Ajah,
      although less so than the Amyrlin Seat herself.  However, both of the
      current Keepers have tried to expand their powers over the Amyrlin they
      serve, although for vastly different reasons&mdash;Alviarin is essentially
      trying to weaken Elaida and have herself or another Black sister raised
      in her place after Elaida is deposed; Sheriam tries to overstep

      accompanied <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A>'s deposition and joined
      <A Href="#Valda">Eamon Valda</A>'s band of the Children of the Light.
      Because of his sword skill, Galad was promoted to an official position
      very quickly, and now controls his own small band of men.  He says he
      became a Whitecloak because it &quot;felt right.&quot;  He is extremely
      virtuous, and will do whatever he thinks is right regardless of who it
      hurts, even himself.  In fact, he started a war in Samara to help Elayne

      Galad has feelings for <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A>, and

      noble House in Cairhien, she is <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail
      Damodred</A>'s youngest half-sister, and <A Href="#Laman">King
      Laman</A>'s niece.  She is considered short among her people, and the
      Cairhienin are already a short people.  When it was discovered that she
      had the ability to channel inborn, Moiraine went to Tar Valon to become
      an Aes Sedai.  Just before being raised to the shawl, she and her friend
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> witnessed Gitara Moroso's Foretelling
      of the Rebirth of the <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>.  Moiraine and Siuan
      walked away from each other and did not speak to each other again (at
      least in public), but both held secret communication with each other and
      dedicated their lives to finding and guiding the
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  Moiraine found the young man she
      sought on Winternight in Emond's Field, a young man named
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, along with two more <I>ta'veren</I>,
      <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A> and <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A>
      and two women with the spark of the Power inborn,
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A> and <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve
      al'Meara</A>.  When Moiraine was shortly raised to the shawl, she met
      <A Href="#Lan">al'Lan Mandragoran</A>, the uncrowned King of Malkier,
      who was fighting alone against the Shadow in the Blight; she asked Lan
      to become her Warder, and he accepted.  She is very strong in the Power,
      stronger than almost all living Aes Sedai.  In the Stone of Tear,
      Moiraine confronted and killed the Forsaken
      <A Href="#Belal">Be'lal</A> with balefire, just before he would have
      killed Rand.  Later, after having an inkling of the future events from
      the testing <I>ter'angreal</I> for the Wise Ones, Moiraine managed to
      push the Forsaken <A Href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</A> through the twisted
      doorway <I>ter'angreal</I> into the land of the Eelfinn, trapping both
      her and Lanfear there.  It is unknown whether Moiraine lives on in the
      land off the Finn, or whether she is dead, but her bond with Lan has
      been severed, and other Aes Sedai consider her a legend, not only for
      discovering the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> but for killing or
      trapping two of the Forsaken as well.  Despite her efforts, and for the
      most part, success, <A Href="#Cadsuane">Cadsuane</A> still thinks she

      <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin</A>.  She sits with
      <A Href="#Lelaine">Lelaine</A>'s Sitters.  She is stocky, and has

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Min">Farshaw, Elmindreda (Min)</A>, p.      271&mdash;Young woman from Baerlon.  She has a special ability that few
      besides herself know about:  she sees images and auras around people,
      especially around Aes Sedai, Warders, and Asha'man, that foretell their
      futures.  Min does not always know what these viewings mean, but when
      she does, it <I>will</I> happen; it is only a question of how and when.
      Min was fascinated by the number of images she saw around
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>, especially the one she saw that included
      herself:  he was destined to fall in love with three different women,
      one of which was herself.  She usually dresses in attire reserved for
      men; this habit was picked up when growing up with her father, who was a
      miner.  However, once she started to develop feelings for Rand, she
      began to wear more traditionally feminine attire.  Min was in Tar Valon
      helping <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A> with her viewings' information when
      Siuan was deposed, and it was Min that freed Siuan and
      <A Href="#Leane">Leane</A> from the dungeon.  She accompanied the two
      former leaders of the Aes Sedai to Salidar; once there, she left for
      Caemlyn with Salidar's embassy to Rand.  Once in Caemlyn, she brought
      information to Rand about the embassy there, and its intentions.  She
      has only had one viewing that ever failed, which concerned
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>; since Moiraine is believed dead, she
      hopes that her viewings might be wrong at least once in a while.  Min is
      one of only three women that can rightfully call herself a lover to the
      <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon Reborn</A>, and she is now bonded to Rand via a
      Warder bond that she shares with the other two,
      <A Href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</A> and <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>.  She
      is fond of reading books by the late <A Href="#Fel">Herid Fel</A>, a
      philosopher who worked in Rand's school of thought and was killed by a
      <I>gholam</I>, presumably because he had stumbled upon information
      crucial to the defeat of the Shadow.  She had a viewing of Elayne just
      before the door closed that Elayne would become pregnant with twins; she
      told half the palace before Elayne herself knew....  <I>See also</I>

      battle at Dumai's Wells.  One of her Warders died from the shock; the
      other died while killing Aiel, making no attempt to escape.  She has
      since been Healed by <A Href="#Flinn">Damer Flinn</A>, and is now

      married, and Greens who marry seldom take more than one Warder.  She
      left him in Cairhien, but he has followed her to Tear.  He is tall,
      lean, and pretty with pale hair, and has a harsh voice.  She has spent
      the past twenty years convincing everyone else that they were married so
      no one would be suspicious of them being alone together.  He likes
      killing.  <I>Editor's note:  It is not revealed whether Fearil knows
      that Elza is Black Ajah, but since we are told he likes killing, it only
      makes sense that he does.</I>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Tarna">Feir, Tarna</A>, p. 56&mdash;Aes Sedai of the      Red Ajah.  <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A> sent her to Salidar to
      communicate with the Aes Sedai there and report about their camp and
      their numbers.  She has long, pale, yellow hair, a strong jaw, and blue
      eyes that could freeze the Sun.  She was a wilder, and had her block
      beaten out of her by <A Href="#Galina">Galina Casban</A>.  She is as
      jumpy as a novice.  <I>Note:  Tarna says at one point that Galina
      &ldquo;knew [her] Ajah long before [she] did, and took a personal
      interest in [her].&rdquo;  This is just speculation, but I think it was
      the Black (not Red) Ajah that Galina knew she would choose.  It
      certainly fits with the idea of most Aes  Sedai in the Tower being
      Black, and with Galina's personal interest in Tarna.  Again, it's just
      speculation....</I>
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Fel">Fel, Herid</A>, p. 557&mdash;Late philosopher      who worked in <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s school of thought at the
      <A Href="#Barthanes">Barthanes</A> estate in Cairhien.  He was torn limb
      from limb by a <I>gholam</I> for unknown reasons, although it is likely
      that he had stumbled upon something quite damaging to the cause of the
      Shadow if they would send a <I>gholam</I> to do the job.
      <A Href="#Min">Min</A> is currently reading his book, <I>Reason and
      Unreason</I>, in an attempt to better understand why he was murdered.

      Harnder</A>, the Second Librarian, claims to have a weakness for her
      ale.  She keeps pigeons, however, and sends one of them north every time
      he visits.  She also received three hooded guests, who were reported to
      be Brown Aes Sedai, behind closed doors for over an hour&mdash;this leads
      <A Href="#Harfor">Mistress Harfor</A> to believe that Harnder and Fendry
      are both spies for the Brown Ajah.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Fera">Fera</A>, p. 560&mdash;Aes Sedai of the
      White Ajah.  She is one of those under the instruction of the Wise Ones

      was unaware of this until she arrived in Cairhien.  She is not in Elza's

      white hair around the edge of his head.  He was in the Queen's Guards
      until he took a Murandian lance in the thigh, and ever since has desired
      to help people with injuries.  He came for the amnesty to see if he
      could learn to Heal; as it turns out, he is very Talented, and has
      developed methods of Healing that have been forgotten since the Age of
      Legends.  He managed to partially Heal <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s wound
      in his side, to separate it from the rest of his body so the evil does
      not seep into it anymore.  Since he was placed on
      <A Href="#Taim">Taim</A>'s Traitors' List, he has been in hiding&mdash;he did
      not assist in the attack on <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>, but Rand thinks it
      better to be safe than to have him killed.  He has since been bonded as
      Warder to <A Href="#Corele">Corele</A>, and has been attempting to

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Andaya">Forae, Andaya</A>, p. 50&mdash;Sitter for the      Gray Ajah in Tar Valon.  She has light brown hair, and grew up in
      Tarabon.  She reminds <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A> of a sparrow about to
      hop to another branch.  She is neither small nor slim.
      <A Href="#Serancha">Serancha</A>, the head of the Gray Ajah, practically
      annointed her to her seat in the Hall.  Everyone expected Andaya to be

      years to pass before it occured.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Julanya">Fote, Julanya</A>, p. 347&mdash;One of the      Kin.  She and <A Href="#Sabeine">Sabeine</A> were sent to visit some of
      the Andoran villages a few miles south of the border with Cairhien,
      and the villages reported that they think the armies from the

      She is among the sisters that are now
      sworn to obey <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>.  She is now in Caemlyn.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alviarin">Freidhen, Alviarin</A>, p. 47&mdash;Aes Sedai      of the White Ajah, but secretly the head of the Black Ajah.  She was
      chosen to head the Black Ajah after the previous leader was killed by
      <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A> after she managed to kill off the
      <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A> without Ishamael's approval.
      Typical of most Whites, she has a very cool, collected personality.
      She serves as <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A> under
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>, despite being of a different Ajah than
      Elaida was raised from.  Elaida was all but forced to choose Alviarin in
      order to gain the support of the White Ajah when bringing charges
      against <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A>; unknown to Elaida, this also brought
      her the support of the Black Ajah.  Without Alviarin as Keeper, the
      White Ajah would most likely have been divided over whether to depose
      Siuan, and only the Red would be behind Elaida, which would most likely
      have led to the stilling of Elaida and possibly even the dismantling of
      the Red Ajah.  It still may, since Elaida is rapidly losing her power to
      Alviarin&mdash;and if Alviarin's loyalties are ever revealed, nothing will
      save either of them.  Alviarin has been shown how to Travel by
      <A Href="#Mesaana">Mesaana</A>, though it is unclear whether she has
      actually used this ability yet.  She appears to know that the Aes Sedai
      sent back from Salidar are spies; she refused to let Elaida speak with

      Several years later, Karede was named to the

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Lan">Mandragoran, al'Lan</A>, p. 533&mdash;The      uncrowned king of Malkier, and formerly Warder to
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>.  He is quite tall, and does not get
      very emotional&mdash;in fact, he has emotional walls all around him that he
      has been building for years.  His country, Malkier, was overrun by
      Trollocs shortly after he was born, and is now corrupted by the Great
      Blight.  Lan, the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a one-man
      war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight.  He fought
      Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status.  He was
      eventually bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at least
      changed its style).  When Lan and Moiraine brought
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>, <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>,
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A>, <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>, and
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> out of their home in the Two Rivers, he
      found that there was something which could throw his guard down, but he
      was the last to notice it:  affection for Nynaeve.  As Moiraine put it,
      Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan's emotional walls and break them
      down without him even knowing they were there.  The two of them are now
      married.  Upon Moiraine's death, Lan's bond was immediately transferred
      to <A Href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</A> until Nynaeve is ready to have his
      bond transferred to her.  Myrelle tried to keep Lan's status secret, but
      she was given away when she tried to buy one of Lan's favorite foods,
      coin peppers, too far south (they are very popular in Shienar, and were
      in Malkier before it fell to the Blight, but do not grow well in
      southern climates).  Upon learning of where Lan was,
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> sent him to Ebou Dar to serve as a Warder
      for Nynaeve.  He now travels with his wife and the group of Aes Sedai
      she accompanies.  According to the Wise Ones,
      <I><A Href="#Aan">Aan'allein</A></I> (as the Aiel call him) will die the
      day he learns that Nynaeve is dead.  He is one of the best, if not

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Nynaeve">Mandragoran, el'Nynaeve ti al'Meara</A>,      p. 307&mdash;Young woman from Emond's Field, now an Aes Sedai
      of the Yellow Ajah.  She was the Wisdom of her village, the youngest
      such ever chosen in Emond's Field.  She left when four of her villagers
      were taken away from the Two Rivers by <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>
      and <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>.  While the group traveled away from her home
      and toward her new life, Nynaeve made several discoveries:  she could
      channel the One Power, and had already done so without really knowing
      what she was doing; she developed feelings for Lan Mandragoran,
      Moiraine's Warder and the uncrowned king of the now dead nation Malkier;
      and she has a major role to play, as all of her younger friends in the
      group do, in the years to come.  She is very strong in the One Power;
      only a select few who were alive during the Age of Legends could match
      her as well as a few young women still being trained.  When she arrived
      in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a novice,
      despite not being able to even <I>sense</I> the True Source unless
      angry, a result of her having to learn some minimal control of her
      ability without teaching.  She was sent on a false mission by
      <A Href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</A> on which she was almost leashed by the
      Seanchan as <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> was.  After she returned to the
      Tower, <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> sent her on a mission to hunt
      down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in
      Tanchico, she encountered <A Href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</A> and managed
      to better her in a duel of the Power.  Moghedien escaped, but two
      encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her,
      leashing her with an <I>a'dam</I> in <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>.  Nynaeve
      took Moghedien with her to seek out <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> and
      <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A> while they were fighting each other, and at
      the last moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin
      to ash with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could
      draw to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain
      control of himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire.  Nynaeve then kept
      Moghedien under control with a modified <I>a'dam</I> in Salidar.
      Nynaeve wished to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she
      thinks the Tower meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and
      wants no part of it.  She is determined to Heal anything short of death,
      and has already managed to Heal gentling.  Nynaeve felt bad when
      Moiraine died, because her first thought was not of her, but that now
      Lan was free from their bond.  She was not told that Lan's bond had been
      passed to <A Href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</A> at the moment of Moiraine's
      death.  She and Lan are now married, and the plan is for Lan's bond to
      pass to her as soon as she and Myrelle can get together.  As Lan's wife,
      she will become the Queen of Malkier when and if Lan raises the Golden
      Crane and frees Malkier from the Blight.  She now wears the
      <I>ki'sain</I>, an ornament traditionally worn by Malkieri wives,
      consisting of a dot on the forehead between the eyes&mdash;Lan did not
      tell her of this tradition, but when she found out she immediately took
      it up.  It is the one element of her appearance that never fades for one
      second when every other part changes faster than the eye can follow in
      <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>.  Because she was the only person Rand felt he
      could trust to link with him and the Choedan Kal, he asked Nynaeve to
      assist him when he cleansed <I>saidin</I>.  She is now recovering from
      the exertion, as is Rand, in Tear.

      reason <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> kept her around in Caemlyn was to push

      in the hands of Arymilla.  Once <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> returned to

      of where <A Href="#Naean">Naean</A> and <A Href="#Elenia">Elenia</A>
      were being detained in Murandy and rescued them.  This debt of sorts
      bound House Arawn and House Sarand to support Arymilla's claim to the

      from Falme to Tar Valon.  Her Warder is named
      <A Href="#Tomas">Tomas</A>.  She is more interested in current events
      than the average Brown; most of them could not care less what happened
      now, only what happened years ago.  She gave Egwene the twisted stone
      ring <I>ter'angreal</I> to assist her in Dreaming, and also once told
      <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A> that there was really no need to keep her
      in the Tower until she learned to control her ability when she was a
      novice, since she would never be able to do much with it anyway.  When
      Verin went to the Two Rivers with <A Href="#Alanna">Alanna</A>, they
      helped to fight the Trollocs that attacked, and when they left they
      brought a half-dozen young women with them who could channel, including

      Alanna reached Caemlyn, they found that the Tower had been broken, and
      decided to side with the Salidar embassy when it reached town.  Verin is
      quite old&mdash;her hair is starting to turn gray, which to an Aes Sedai
      means she is quite old indeed.  She is now with

      she was obeying Elaida's summons.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Cadsuane">Melaidhrin, Cadsuane</A>, p. 71&mdash;Aes      Sedai of the Green Ajah with iron-gray hair.  She retired to a rose
      garden in northern Ghealdan, but has since left it due to the difficulty
      of growing decent roses with the weather the way it used to be.  She
      refused two appointments to the Hall of the Tower, when refusing even
      once is unheard of.  She also refused to become head of the Green Ajah.
      It is said that she has had more Warders than most sisters have had
      shoes.  She has more strength than anyone in a thousand years except
      perhaps for <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> and
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>.  Although she is a Green, she has
      confronted and captured more men that can channel than any other woman;
      unknown to most, the men she captures tend to live longer after being
      gentled than the average.  She is somewhat of a living legend among Aes
      Sedai.  According to <A Href="#Min">Min</A>, Cadsuane will teach
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> and the Asha'man something&mdash;they will not like
      it, especially not from her, but they will have to learn it.  She is the
      oldest Aes Sedai alive.  Cadsuane wears many ornaments in her hair, all
      of which are <I>ter'angreal</I> she has collected over the years.  One
      of them is a reservoir&mdash;it &ldquo;stores&rdquo; <I>saidar</I> for
      later use in places where one might not be able to tap the Source, such
      as inside an Ogier <I>stedding</I> or inside Far Madding, her hometown.
      Another vibrates in the presence of men who can channel; it is likely
      this ornament that has allowed her to capture so many men to be gentled.
      There are many others, including three that she does not know the
      purpose of.  <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A> suspects Cadsuane may be a

      took the poisoned dagger from the third and killed him with it.  He is
      wiry, has a sharp face, and is coldhearted, though he smiles a lot.  He
      is fond of teasing women.  He claims to have been a merchant's guard,
      then a mercenary, then a Hunter for the Horn.  He is now a lieutenant in
      the Queen's Guards, and in gratitude, Elayne made him the captain of her
      bodyguard.  He has dark eyes a narrow face that is not pretty or
      handsome.  He moves with a swordsman's grace, and is very strong.
      Mellar claims to be from Andor, near Baerlon, and he claims to have

      Half the palace has accepted the rumor that he is the father of Elayne's
      twins, though he himself may be unaware that this rumor exists.

      that she keeps in a tight bun at the back of her head.  She ran a very
      large family with a very firm hand until her children (and their
      children) grew up.  She seems to have adopted all of the novices as
      granddaughters, or at least as great nieces.  She was the woman who
      organized all the novices into &ldquo;families&rdquo;&mdash;she was
      apparently disgusted watching everyone simply floundering around.

      <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A> from Nynaeve's test for being raised to Accepted.
      These tests are based on possible future events, and the chance that

      ago.  She was raised from the Red Ajah, the last Amyrlin besides
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A> from the Red.  She tried to use the Tower's
      influence to manipulate Hawkwing and make him a puppet ruler of the
      White Tower.  This ended in disaster, as Hawkwing laid seige to Tar
      Valon and attempted to destroy the Aes Sedai stronghold&mdash;he nearly
      succeeded.  Bonwhin was stripped of stole and staff and stilled for
      nearly destroying the Tower, and since then no Amyrlin from her Ajah has
      been raised.  She was succeeded by <A Href="#Aryman">Deane Aryman</A> of
      the Blue Ajah, who took office after years of disorder in the Tower
      where no Amyrlin was chosen and attempted to undo the damage Bonwhin did
      to the Tower's reputation.  Deane succeeded for the most part.
      Unfortunately, this created extreme tension between the Red and Blue
      Ajahs that still exists today, and is the main reason why the Red Ajah
      will (and did) take any pretext to pull down an Amyrlin raised from the

      second from her House to sit on the throne&mdash;this was the maximum
      traditionally, and the only House to hold it for four generations fell
      so fast from power that it could not recover.  She was advised by

      a widow, and does not plan to marry again.  However, she took an

      always works from safety, attacks from safety, and will run unless she

      Moghedien in the World of Dreams.  After being released from the Bore,
      Moghedien eventually found herself in Tanchico, in the Palace of the
      Panarch of Tarabon.  While there, she chanced upon
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</A>, who was trying to save the
      Panarch at the time and take the seal on the <A Href="#Dark">Dark
      One</A>'s prison from its hold in the Palace.  She and Nynaeve fought in
      a duel to the last, and Nynaeve managed to better Moghedien, much to the
      surprise of both of them.  She managed to escape Nynaeve's tied off
      shield, and on their next encounter, this one in <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>,
      she ripped <A Href="#Birgitte">Birgitte</A>'s soul out of the World of

      causing trouble in the Hall, especially with her demands to make a
      formal declaration that <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A> is Black Ajah.  She
      is willing to discuss any subject in the Hall, whereas most Sitters
      will not touch topics such as the Black Ajah with a ten-foot pole.  Her
      pale blue eyes give nothing away.  Like many of her fellow members of
      the Hall, she is young to be a Sitter.  Her maid is named

      bonded against his will) and <A Href="#Ihvon">Ihvon</A>; her other,
      <A Href="#Owein">Owein</A>, died in the Two Rivers while scouting the
      Whitecloak camp.  She later found that bonding Rand was a grievious
      error; not only is it impossible to Compel him in comparison to most
      Warders (she compared it to attempting to uproot an oak tree with her
      bare hands), but she constantly feels the pain he experiences from the
      wound in his side, perhaps even more severely than he feels it.  She is
      now in Tear, but the other Aes Sedai there are avoiding her notice.

      and the villages reported that they think the armies from the

      is short, pale, and quite ugly.  He likes to chase women.  He is a good
      horse racer, and travels with Mat and <A Href="#Luca">Luca</A>'s show.
      He has a certain fascination with the game Snakes and Foxes, and does
      not seem to understand that there is no way to win without cheating.
      <I>Note:  many people think that Olver may be the Rebirth of
      <A Href="#Gaidal">Gaidal Cain</A>&mdash;he is certainly ugly, as Gaidal was,

      based on dealings with the Aelfinn and Eelfinn, will allow him (or Mat,
      <A Href="#Thom">Thom</A>, or someone else who would observe his

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Dark">One, Dark</A>, p. 124&mdash;Name used in every      land for Shai'tan, the source of all evil, complete antithesis of
      <A Href="#Creator">The Creator</A> in every way.  At the moment of
      Creation, Shai'tan was imprisoned by the Creator at Shayol Ghul.  This
      prison kept him from touching the world until it was bored into by Aes
      Sedai during the Age of Legends.  This hole, called the Bore, allowed
      the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new outbreaks of
      war, treachery, violence, and crime.  The attempt to free the Dark One
      completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the War of Power by
      some, especially those on the Shadow's side), during which a number of
      important leaders forsook the Light and gave their lives to the Dark
      One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of the
      most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  The War of the Shadow
      did not end until <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A>, the
      <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>, and his Hundred Companions Traveled to
      Shayol Ghul and re-sealed the Dark One back into his prison, trapping
      the Forsaken with him.  At the moment of sealing, Shai'tan lashed out at
      those sealing the prison, driving them insane and tainting <I>saidin</I>
      itself, the male half of the True Source, dooming all male Aes Sedai to
      madness as well and starting the Time of Madness.  These seals are
      weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the Dark One is
      once again able to exert influence on the world.  These seals were
      scattered throughout the world by Aes Sedai during the Breaking of the
      World.  In order of when they were discovered, they were found:  1) At
      the Eye of the World (broken when it was found); 2) in the hands of
      <A Href="#Domon">Bayle Domon</A>, later pilfered by
      <A Href="#Turak">High Lord Turak</A> of the Seanchan (broken at the
      battle of Falme), 3) On Seanchan, part of High Lord Turak's collection
      (broken at the battle at Falme); 4) In the Great Hold at the Stone of
      Tear (still intact); 5) In the Panarch's Palace in Tanchico (broken
      enroute to Salidar); 6) One in Rhuidean (still intact), and 7) Found by
      <A Href="#Taim">Mazrim Taim</A> on a small farm in Saldaea (still
      intact).  Despite being made of <I>cuendillar</I>, the three that remain
      unbroken can be cut with a knife and would break by a fall from a table.
      The Dark One is also referred to by other euphemisms, including
      Sightblinder, Lord of the Grave, Father of Lies, Grassburner,
      Leafblighter, Heartfang, Heartsbane, Soulsbane, Lord of the Twilight,
      Father of Storms, Shepherd of the Night, Soulblinder, and (among

      <A Href="#Leane">Leane</A> very well when they were stilled, either.

      Tower on the first boat to leave after she discovered she had the
      ability to channel inborn, according to Tairen law.  As a novice, she
      was good friends with <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine Damodred</A>, and was
      present at <A Href="#Gitara">Gitara Moroso</A>'s Foretelling of the
      Rebirth of the <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>.  After being raised to the
      shawl, she joined the Blue Ajah to dedicate her life to finding and
      guiding the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>, and eventually came to
      lead the Blues' network of eyes-and-ears (i.e. spies) before being
      raised to the <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>.  She was only thirty
      years old when raised to the Amyrlin Seat, making her the youngest
      Amyrlin to that point.  She was also one of the strongest Amyrlins in
      recent history, and one of the most feared among the rulers of nations.
      Her blue-eyed stare was feared by all.  When her twenty-year connection
      to the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> was discovered, she and her
      <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A>, <A Href="#Leane">Leane
      Sharif</A>, were deposed and stilled by a group of sisters loyal to
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida a'Roihan</A>.  Siuan hoped to regain some of
      her previous standing in the new Tower that separated from
      Elaida&mdash;her knowledge of the Blue Ajah spy network is hard to
      match, and she knows much that she thought would be of use.  In one of
      her viewings, <A Href="#Min">Min</A> saw that Siuan would have to remain
      close by to <A Href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</A>&mdash;if she did not, both
      of them would die.  Siuan did not initially know what she meant, but now
      realizes that she is growing to love the gray-haired man who leads the
      Salidar army.  She had a Warder named <A Href="#Alric">Alric</A>, but he
      died when she was deposed.  After coming to Salidar,
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> discovered how to restore Siuan's ability
      to channel, at least partially.  This resurrected a part of her bond
      with Alric, but did not bring back her former strength, or her binding
      by the Oath Rod.  She can now lie as well as any child.  She now serves
      as an &ldquo;advisor&rdquo; to the new Amyrlin in Salidar,
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A>, but though she puts on a
      fa&ccedil;ade of hating the work, she is actually one of Egwene's
      foremost agents.  The fact that she is Aes Sedai, not to mention one who
      was stilled and Healed again, makes other sisters tend to be oblivious
      to this fact.  She was pushed very hard by Elaida as a novice.

      its meetings.  Kings and queens of nations strong and weak will come if
      summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their entire trip figuring
      out how they will put a knife in her back while there.  The Seat is
      traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in her
      character.  The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must the
      vote to depose one.  Once chosen, the Amyrlin is said to be &quot;of all
      Ajahs and none&quot;&mdash;all previous affiliations with Ajah are ignored
      (at least in theory).  The Ajahs have gotten fairly equal numbers of
      Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions:  no Amyrlin has
      been raised from the Red Ajah since
      <A Href="../book5/alphalast.html#Bonwhin">Bonwhin Meraighdin</A>, who
      was deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in

      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</A>, the current Amyrlin
      Seat in Tar Valon; the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of
      Amyrlins from its Ajah&mdash;four of the last the last five Amyrlins (before
      Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah.  These two exceptions to the
      mean number of Amyrlins from one's Ajah have only added to the friction
      between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years.  The Amyrlin has a
      secretary of sorts, the <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A>,
      who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the Amyrlin was
      raised from.  The Amyrlin Seat was held by <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan
      Sanche</A>, raised from the Blue Ajah, until she was deposed for her
      involvement with events surrounding the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon
      Reborn</A>.  Her successor was the leader of the coup,
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</A>, raised from the Red
      Ajah.  Siuan's deposition divided the Tower, and the faction opposing
      Elaida raised a new Amyrlin who could not be accused of choosing sides
      on the fateful day Siuan was deposed:  <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene

      her family members were training her in the seductive ways of Domani
      women, Leane found that her life would take a different direction:  she
      could channel <I>saidar</I>, and would do so with or without teaching.
      She became an Aes Sedai, a member of the Blue Ajah, and was eventually
      raised to <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A> under
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>.  During the coup

      <A Href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</A> that deposed Siuan, Leane was
      thrown in the dungeon and stilled.  Leane tried turning to her seductive
      side to try to replace what she lost in stilling; she was out of
      practice, but did well enough.  She eventually convinced the Aes Sedai
      in Salidar to let her stay with them and maintain the network of
      eyes-and-ears she kept in Tar Valon as Keeper.  She was later Healed by
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>, and restored to some of her former
      capacity for using the One Power.  The Hall of the Tower in Salidar
      decided that since she had been stilled, she was no longer Aes Sedai for
      that time and thus all of her titles and choice of Ajah were null and
      void.  Instead of petitioning to re-enter the Blue Ajah, she asked the
      Green Ajah if it would accept her; it did, and she became the first
      sister to ever switch Ajahs.  Her eyes-and-ears as Keeper are retained
      by her; she was the only Aes Sedai to plant spies in the city itself.

      strong enough to weave a gateway by herself, but linked they can just
      barely manage one big enough to walk through.  She instructed
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> when Egwene was a novice in the White
      Tower.  She is vigorous, and square-faced&mdash;she looks more like a Green
      than a Tower librarian&mdash;and she is always <I>far</I> beyond proper.  Her
      deep curtsies to Egwene usually suggest mockery, and she has been known
      to curtsy from over a hundred paces away.

      Ajah in Tar Valon.  She is bonily thin and taller than most men.  She
      has an angular face, long chin, spidery fingers, and curly hair.  She
      was a very recent addition to the Hall, though unlike many of the other
      sisters raised in recent weeks, she was actually a logical choice to
      succeed&mdash;<A Href="#Saerin">Saerin</A> had mentioned that Shevan would

      other High Lords took to hiding in Haddon Mirk&mdash;they were traitors
      to the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  He has since returned to

      Lords return from Illian.

      battle at Cairhien was over.  <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> says he almost
      admires him&mdash;he opposed Rand from the very start, fleeing the Stone
      of Tear when it fell and trying to rouse resistance among the rural
      nobles.  He was considering <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>'s offer of
      support if he declared himself king of Tear, until he was made the
      Steward for the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> in Tear.  Rand
      figures that this will keep the nobles scheming among themselves so much
      that they will not have time to make trouble for him.

      more spirited a mount than <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> would have

      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>, and travels with <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A>

      she accidentally spoke to <I>gai'shain</I> as if they were still Maidens
      of the Spear.  To attempt to equal their shame, she became a servant in
      the palace, dressed in the same clothing they wore and attempted to
      behave in their manner.  She ended her tenure as a servant when she
      learned that Rand had been captured, and led the rescue party of Maidens
      to Dumai's Wells.  She then went with <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A> to

      He is little taller than <A Href="#Min">Min</A>, and has dark eyes and

      hair on the sides to his shoulders.  He was the only Cairhienin noble to
      retain a sizable force after the Shaido invasion.  He is the Steward of
      Cairhien for the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>; he rules the

      captured by Aes Sedai.  He later escaped his captors, possibly with
      Black Ajah assistance (although this is totally unconfirmed).  Hearing
      of <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s amnesty, Taim came to Caemlyn and became
      the head of Rand's school of male channelers.  He is almost as strong in
      the One Power as Rand is.  Taim claims to have held off the madness that
      normally accompanies the taint for almost 35 years&mdash;he has been
      using the One Power for a very long time, and knows many tricks that
      Rand had not thought of on his own or been taught by
      <A Href="#Asmodean">Asmodean</A>, such as how to test men for the
      ability.  He seems to resent being second to Rand, and also gave orders
      to kill Rand.  He is almost as tall as Rand, has a hooked nose and dark
      eyes.  He is a physically powerful and graceful man, although his skill
      with a sword is lacking.  He gives special training to about 20 or 30
      men&mdash;they are the only ones who wear the dragon besides
      <A Href="#Logain">Logain</A>  <I>Note:  there is </I>still<I> an ongoing

      recognize <A Href="#Flinn">Damer Flinn</A> despite Taim's having trained

      until <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A> fled Andor.  When
      <A Href="#Gaebril">Gaebril</A> had the guards swear new oaths to the
      laws and customs of Andor (instead of to the Queen), Tallanvor swore
      them but immediately went back to his room and reswore the old oath in
      the old style (cutting his arm with his sword, indicating that his blood
      will be shed before the Queen's will).  He loves his queen more than his
      life, and now serves as her personal bodyguard.  He went looking for her
      himself when Morgase was captured by the Shaido, and brought word back
      to <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A> that the Seanchan were also hunting the
      Shaido, and an alliance might be possible.

      Cairhien when <A Href="#Cadsuane">Cadsuane</A> left prior to the
      cleansing of <I>saidin</I>, and is now with the entourage of sisters
      that obey Cadsuane and protect <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>.  She tried to
      Heal Rand's side wound and failed, but when <A Href="#Flinn">Damer
      Flinn</A> was able to Heal him using a more sophisticated weave, she
      begged on her knees for him to teach her.  She is slender, has hazel

      Altaran Marches.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Pevara">Tazanovni, Pevara</A>, p.      40&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Red Ajah.  She is short for a Kandori, and
      quite plump, but tough.  She goes against all Red Ajah custom to openly
      say that Warders would make a Red sister's job easier.  She and her
      friend since novicehood,
      <A Href="#Seaine">Seaine</A>, began a hunt for Darkfriends in the
      Tower.  Seaine approached her not only because they were friends, but
      because Seaine's family was killed by Darkfriends when she was young.
      She joined the Red Ajah because its task was one which involved being
      outside the Tower often, and she considered it more likely to be able to
      find and bring to justice the Darkfriends that killed her family and
      others like them.  She now leads the organization of sisters in the
      White Tower to ferret out Black sisters, along with
      <A Href="#Saerin">Saerin Sedai</A>, who seized control away from

      most prominent beseiger of the Stone of Tear.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Lews">Telamon, Lews Therin</A>, p. 545&mdash;The      <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>, Breaker of the World.  He was perhaps the
      greatest man who ever lived, and the most powerful Aes Sedai in recorded
      history.  During the War of the Shadow, he led the forces of the Light
      against the Forsaken, and led the final stroke which re-sealed the
      <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A> back into his prison.  Unfortunately,
      during this stroke he was driven insane by the Dark One's touch,
      eventually killing his wife <A Href="#Ilyena">Ilyena</A>, his children,
      and everyone he loved, as well as anyone who carried a drop of his
      blood.  For this act, people remember him with a new name:
      <A Href="#Kinslayer">Kinslayer</A>.  After he had done this,
      <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A> gave him his sanity back long enough
      for him to realize what he had done; Lews Therin killed himself by
      drawing on <I>saidin</I> too heavily, causing a mountain to form on the
      spot where he stood.  This mountain is called Dragonmount, and is near
      the present-day city of Tar Valon.  It is unfortunate that the name of
      one of the greatest men to ever live is now synonymous with evil, for
      Lews Therin killed his family due to the Dark One's influence, but
      without Lews Therin there may not have been a world left in which to
      kill them.  Lews Therin's voice often speaks inside
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s head, offering advice or sobbing over lost
      women or ranting about killing men who can channel.  It even tries to
      seize control of <I>saidin</I> sometimes, much to Rand's fear&mdash;Rand is
      certain that Lews Therin cannot take control of <I>saidin</I> away from
      him if he seizes it first, but he is almost as certain that if Lews
      Therin seizes it first, he will not be able to snatch it back.

      <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail</A>, and sister to
      <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>.  She is also half-sister to
      <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A>, although she would rather not be reminded of
      this fact; she thinks Galad virtuous to the point of fault, and does not
      really like him.  She has considerable potential in the One Power, and
      is one of the strongest Aes Sedai in a thousand years or more,
      possibly since the Age of Legends, with the exceptions of
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>, <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>,
      <A Href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</A>, and some trainees.  She has
      red-gold curly hair.  During her stay in the Stone of Tear, Elayne
      realized she loved <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, and told him how
      she felt; he felt similarly.  She had no idea at the time what
      <A Href="#Min">Min</A> meant about &quot;having to share him,&quot; but
      now knows about Min's viewing of Rand with the three women's heads,
      indicating that Rand will fall in love with Min, Elayne, and Aviendha,
      and they with him.  Later, when she and Nynaeve had trouble with
      <A Href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</A>, Elayne ended up bonding
      <A Href="#Birgitte">Birgitte</A> as her Warder (despite being only
      Accepted at the time) in order to save Birgitte's life.  Elayne later
      went to Ebou Dar and found the Bowl of the Winds, a <I>ter'angreal</I>
      that they used to fix the weather.  She has since returned to Andor upon
      hearing news of her mother's disappearance; she plans to take the Lion
      Throne, as soon as she has garnered enough support to keep it.  In the
      meantime, Elayne has managed to reproduce several <I>ter'angreal</I>,
      something which no one else has been able to do since the Breaking of
      the World, as well as discover a way to share a Warder bond between
      three women; she bonded Rand along with Aviendha, her new sister by Aiel
      tradition, and Min.  Shortly after bonding Rand, she became pregnant
      with Rand's twins.  To protect the children, she is allowing the rumor
      that <A Href="#Mellar">Doilan Mellar</A> fathered them to persist.

      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>.  He will become First Prince of the Sword
      when Elayne becomes Queen.  He and his half-brother
      <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A> went to train with the Warders in the White
      Tower, as all sons of Andoran queens have for centuries, and both now
      possess considerable skill with the sword.  During the chaos that
      erupted after <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>'s deposition, Gawyn
      formed a band of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders
      except Galad, who are called the Younglings.  The Younglings fought back
      against their teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and
      <A Href="#Leane">Leane</A> from their imprisonment.  Gawyn himself
      killed Hammar and Coulin, the men in charge of teaching the sword and
      for his personal training, respectively, both of which were
      Blademasters&mdash;few Warders are as good as they were, and Gawyn
      managed to kill both of them.  With recent developments, Gawyn does not
      know which party to support&mdash;he believes that anyone who opposed
      Tower Law by trying to free Siuan and Leane was wrong, but at the same
      time he does not know all the facts surrounding the change in
      leadership.  In fact, his sister Elayne and her friends
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</A> and
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A> side with those
      who broke from the Tower, and Egwene, the woman he wants to marry, is
      their new leader.  He believes the rumor that <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>
      killed his mother, and only refrains from killing him because Egwene
      made him promise not to.  Gawyn has made many enemies inside and outside
      the Tower, just by leading the Younglings.  He detests Rand because he
      thinks Rand killed his mother (when in fact no one did), and there is no
      telling how he'll react when he finds out that Elayne actually does love
      him (and is carrying his twins), as well as that Egwene heads the
      rebellion against the Tower.  His sign is a white boar.  <I>See also</I>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Morgase">Trakand, Morgase</A>, p. 30&mdash;Former      Queen of Andor and High Seat of House Trakand.  Mother of
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> and <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>.  She
      married <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</A>, a prince of
      Cairhien, to further solidify her claim to the Throne of Andor and keep
      peace between the two nations; when <A Href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</A>
      disappeared, Morgase made the best claim to succeed her, and married her
      widower to gain the support that would be gained by such action.
      Taringail was Elayne's and Gawyn's father; he died when they were young.
      Morgase has since gone through several lovers, including
      <A Href="#Thom">Thomdril Merrilin</A>, a former court-bard;
      <A Href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</A>, her First Prince of the Sword and
      Captain of the Guards; and most recently <A Href="#Gaebril">Lord
      Gaebril</A>, a man who led the faction that stilled the riots in Caemlyn
      that sprang up on Morgase's trip to Tar Valon to inquire about Elayne's
      whereabouts.  Thom was exiled from the city of Caemlyn when he started
      telling her what he really thought of some of her plans, her
      relationship with Bryne ebbed away until finally Gaebril told her to
      exile him too, and Gaebril eventually chased Morgase herself out of the
      city when she found he was usurping her power.  The Daughter-Heir of
      Andor is traditionally trained by Aes Sedai in the White Tower, and
      Morgase underwent novice training to keep the tradition alive.  She was
      given the gift of a Great Serpent ring despite not being Accepted, and
      still wears it on her left hand.  She was previously advised by
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</A> of the Red Ajah, who is
      now the <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A> in Tar Valon.  When Morgase
      discovered that Gaebril (who, unbeknownst to her, was actually
      <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A>) meant to usurp her throne, she left, and
      when she learned that the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> had taken
      over Caemlyn and none of her former supporters would give her aid, she
      fled to Amadicia to get help from the only place she thought she could:
      <A Href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</A> and the Children of the Light.  She is
      not aware that <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> only wanted to give her country
      back to her, not to mention believes that she is dead.  If she had made
      her presence known, she would no doubt have had her country back in one
      piece, but as royalty she believed she must work on her own and trust no
      one.  She went into hiding after the Seanchan attack (Valda believes her
      to be dead) under her mother's name, <A Href="#Dorlain">Maighdin</A> to
      avoid instant recognition, and later became a maidservant to
      <A Href="#Faile">Faile</A>; she told Faile that she was a lady's
      handmaid before coming into her service.  When Faile's group was
      captured, she became a prisoner of the Shaido, and is now detained in
      their encampment.  Her sign is three golden keys.

      <I>sul'dam</I> could learn to channel&mdash;Seta retains her rank as
      <I>sul'dam</I>, but is forbidden to be linked with a <I>damane</I>.  She
      was kept under close watch by <A Href="#Suroth">Suroth</A>.  She has

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Bethamin">Zeami, Bethamin</A>,      p. 149&mdash;<I>Sul'dam</I> who was left behind after the battle at Falme,
      later captured by <A Href="#Egeanin">Egeanin</A>.  When Egeanin found
      her, she tried to get away, so Egeanin snapped the <I>a'dam</I> she was
      carrying around her neck, hoping to use it as one more barrier to the
      woman fleeing (since Bethamin supposedly cannot channel, the <I>a'dam</I>
      should have no other effect than throwing a metal ring around her head).
      Much to Egeanin's surprise, the <I>a'dam</I> held Bethamin just as well
      as it held the <I>damane</I> it was intended for.  Bethamin already knew
      this, from observing <A Href="#Renna">Renna</A>, who
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> left collared after Falme.  From this, and
      from <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>'s and <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>'s
      information about the possibility of learning to channel (not just
      having it inborn), Egeanin reasoned that all <I>sul'dam</I>, including
      Bethamin, could channel if they were taught&mdash;which went against
      everything she had been taught her entire life.  Bethamin is now
      forbidden to be linked to <I>damane</I>, both as protection for her&mdash;if
      anyone besides <A Href="#Suroth">Suroth</A> knew that the <I>a'dam</I>
      would control her, they would probably make her wear it all the
      time&mdash;and as protection for the Seanchan way of life, which would likely
      collapse if it was learned that <I>sul'dam</I> could channel just as
      well as <I>damane</I>.  She has since been spirited away from Ebou Dar

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Roedran">a'Naloy, Roedran Almaric do Arreloa</A>,      p. 340&mdash;King of Murandy, at least in name.  In reality, Murandians hold

      of Murandy in its history.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Elaida">a'Roihan, Elaida do Avriny</A>, p.      39&mdash;Aes Sedai formerly of the Red Ajah, now raised to the
      <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A> in Tar Valon.  She was born the
      youngest daughter of a minor House in the north of Murandy.  She
      occasionally has the Foretelling, and as a result of a Foretelling she
      had concerning the importance of the Royal Family of Andor in Tarmon
      Gaidon, she served as advisor to <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A> of
      Andor for her entire reign.  She later led the coup that deposed
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> and placed her on the Amyrlin Seat in
      Siuan's place.  She distrusts anyone not of the Red Ajah (as most Reds
      do), and does not think she will ever be able to trust any member of the
      Blue Ajah again.  Her <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A> is
      <A Href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</A> of the White Ajah&mdash;she was all
      but forced to choose Alviarin due to her role in the deposition of
      Siuan.  If she chose a Keeper from her Ajah, she most likely would not
      have won the support of the White Ajah, and then <I>she</I> would have
      been stilled and banished from the Tower instead of
      Siuan.  Her Foretelling about the importance of Andor's royal family
      during the Last Battle occurred around the time the Succession was going
      on, so she immediately attached herself to Morgase as soon as it became
      clear that she would be the one to take the Lion Throne.  Another of her
      Foretellings was to predict that <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> would
      shake the world on its very foundations&mdash;she constantly kicks herself
      for not doing something about him when he was right in front of her,
      little more than a farmboy at the time.  Her most recent Foretelling was
      that &ldquo;the White Tower would be whole again, except for remnants
      cast out and scorned, whole and stronger than ever.
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> will face the Amyrlin Seat and know her
      anger.  The Black Tower will be rent in blood and fire, and sisters will
      walk its grounds.&rdquo;  The Foretelling about Rand is obviously deadly
      accurate.  However, the one about the Royal Family occurred at an
      inopportune time; at the time of Elaida's Foretelling, the Royal Family
      was not certain.  It may have meant Morgase,
      <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>, <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A>, and
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> (they have all had a large role to play in
      the recent past), but it is also possible it could have meant the old
      Royal Family, that of <A Href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</A>,
      <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail</A>, Galad, and later Elayne and Gawyn as
      well.  After all, Morgase is just Morgase, but Tigraine is the mother of
      the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  Her most recent Foretelling
      will of course be fulfilled, but not necessarily how she wants it to be;
      she does not realize that the Amyrlin Seat in the Foretelling might not
      be her, that the remnants cast out might be those loyal to her, and that
      the destruction of the Black Tower might have nothing to do with her.
      Elaida is quite strong in the One Power; only Siuan (before she was
      still and Healed), <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>,
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>, <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>,
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>, and a few others could match her
      strength.  Elaida has always sought positions of power; she chose to
      follow Morgase to have a better chance at guiding the forces in the Last
      Battle, and tried to capture Rand al'Thor in an effort to gain similar
      control.  The only sisters that support her are those that are actually
      Black Ajah and those that would follow any Amyrlin legally raised, as
      Elaida was (although just barely; all laws used to raise her were
      stretched almost to their breaking point, and some believe they actually
      <I>did</I> shatter).  Elaida is currently building a palace for herself
      atop the Warders' old practice yard.  The building will be about as tall
      as the White Tower.  She has no plans on being merciful on those who
      rebelled against her when she deposed Siuan&mdash;her terms are that the Blue
      Ajah no longer exists, and that any sister following Egwene must serve
      penance under her personal guidance before being readmitted to the
      Tower.  <I>See also</I>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Rand">al'Thor, Rand</A>, p. 30&mdash;Young man from      Emond's Field in the Two Rivers, now proclaimed to be the
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  He is very tall, with curly
      red-blond hair.  He was raised by <A Href="#Tam">Tam al'Thor</A> and his
      wife <A Href="#Kari">Kari</A> (until her death around the time Rand was
      five) in Emond's Field.  His real parents, however, were
      <A Href="#Janduin">Janduin</A>, the chief of the Taardad Aiel who brought
      the four clans across the Dragonwall to punish
      <A Href="#Laman">Laman</A>'s Sin, and a Maiden of the Spear named
      <A Href="#Shaiel">Shaiel</A>, who was actually
      <A Href="#Tigraine">Tigraine Damodred</A>, the runaway Daughter-Heir of
      Andor.  Tigraine gave birth to Rand on the slopes of Dragonmount, in
      accordance with prophecy; &quot;born of a Maiden, of the ancient blood
      but raised by the Old.&quot;  Rand has a heron branded into each of his
      palms, which he received from the sword Tam gave him while fighting
      <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A>.  He also has two
      dragons on his forearms, which he received in Rhuidean to designate him
      as the <I><A Href="#Caracarn">Car'a'carn</A></I>, the Chief of Chiefs of
      the Aiel.  He is not only the Dragon Reborn, but also <A Href="#Dawn">He
      Who Comes With the Dawn</A>, the man prophecied to reunite the Aiel, and
      the <A Href="#Coramoor">Coramoor</A>, the one prophecied to bring the
      Sea Folk out of the Sea.  He can channel strongly, more so than any
      person who ever lived (except the previous user of his soul,
      <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A>, who was obviously of equal
      strength), and is also <I>ta'veren</I>, the most strongly so since Lews
      Therin as well.  Lews Therin's voice has somehow found a new place inside
      of Rand's head; he talks to him in a mad voice when Rand least expects
      it, sometimes offering sound advice or knowledge, sometimes babbling,
      sometimes even trying to wrest control of <I>saidin</I> from him.
      Unlike Lews Therin, Rand is accompanied by two other
      <I>ta'veren</I> during this turing of the Wheel, two men born within days
      (hours, even) of him named <A Href="#Mat">Matrim Cauthon</A> and
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A>, who both grew up in Emond's Field as
      well.  Rand is destined to fall in love with three women (and has):
      <A Href="#Min">Min Farshaw</A>, <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</A>, and
      <A Href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</A>.  Rand has had success in fighting many
      of the Forsaken; all to confront him have died or been trapped.  He
      killed <A Href="#Aginor">Aginor</A> at the Eye of
      the World after the <A Href="../book1/alphalast.html#Green">Green Man</A>
      killed <A Href="#Balthamel">Balthamel</A>; he
      allowed <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> to kill
      <A Href="#Belal">Be'lal</A> in the Stone of Tear, and killed
      <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A> in the Stone shortly afterward; in the
      wagons near the Spine of the World, <A Href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</A>
      confronted him and was pushed into the land of the Eelfinn by Moiraine;
      he killed <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A> in <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I> when he
      came to the Royal Palace in Caemlyn;
      <A Href="#Asmodean">Asmodean</A>, his teacher, was killed shortly after
      Rahvin met his fate; and <A Href="#Osan">Osan'gar</A>, the reincarnation
      of <A Href="#Aginor">Aginor</A>, died at Shador Logoth when Rand was
      cleansing <I>saidin</I>.  His prophecies fulfilled grow:  he has already
      been born on the slopes of Dragonmount of a Maiden, of the ancient blood
      but raised by the old, taken the Stone of Tear and drawn
      <I>Callandor</I>, and began conquering &quot;under the forgotten
      symbol,&quot; that of the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  He is
      working on having the &quot;spotless tower&quot; (i.e. the White Tower)
      break and bend knee to him (the Tower has broken, and several Aes Sedai
      have sworn fealty to him and only him).  He recently used the Choedan
      Kal, the two great <I>sa'angreal</I> created during the War of the
      Shadow, to cleanse the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>'s taint from
      <I>saidin</I>.  He has created a school of sorts, more of a research
      university where some of the best inventors of the day have congregated
      at the Great Library of Cairhien to develop new technology.  Rand has
      also created the Asha'man, men who came for his &quot;amnesty&quot; for
      male channelers.  With <I>saidin</I> cleansed, the Asha'man are now safe
      from the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>'s taint.  However, Rand has not
      been seen since he cleansed <I>saidin</I>, which was certainly the
      single greatest event in the history of the world since the War of
      Power.  Rand is the salvation of the entire world, and as the
      prophecy states, he <I>will</I> save the world&mdash;and Break it again.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Egwene">al'Vere, Egwene</A>, p. 53&mdash;Young      woman from Emond's Field, now raised to the <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin
      Seat</A> among the Aes Sedai opposing <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>.  She
      has considerable strength with the One Power, and will most likely be
      one of the strongest Aes Sedai in over a thousand years.  She is also
      the first Dreamer in the Tower in almost 500 years; she trained with the
      Wise Ones to learn more of this Talent.  Egwene is good friends with
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</A>, the Daughter-Heir of Andor, and is
      also a childhood friend of <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, the
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  In fact, Rand and Egwene were all
      but Promised in their youth, but both of them feel an almost
      sibling-like love for each other now; they know that they cannot get
      married, and do not want to.  Egwene is the love object of both of
      Elayne's brothers, <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A> and
      <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>&mdash;she is flattered by Galad's attentions,
      but she does not return them; she does find Gawyn to her liking, and had
      a dream of bonding him as her Warder; she knows it will occur.  Egwene
      was most likely chosen Amyrlin because she was in the Aiel Waste when
      the rebellion occurred, and because the Aes Sedai thought she could be
      guided by them without too much trouble; if this was their intent, they
      made a grave mistake, for Egwene promises to be one of the strongest
      Amyrlins in history.  Egwene has enlisted <A Href="#Bryne">Gareth
      Bryne</A> as the commander of her army to invade Tar Valon and remove
      Elaida from power.  She has also opened the novice books to all
      interested women for the first time in history&mdash;in the past, they
      were only open to girls of a certain age, for fear that older women
      would not be able to handle the discipline.  This policy has increased
      the size of the rebel Tower to several times the size of the original,
      unified one.  The number of novices has increased to levels not known
      for over a thousand years.  Egwene has also discovered many lost Talents
      of the Age of Legends, such as Dreaming, Traveling, and the making of
      <I>cuendillar</I>.  She was guided to Dreaming by the Wise Ones, with
      whom she studied in the Aiel Waste, and was guided to the making of
      <I>cuendillar</I> by <A Href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</A> while she was
      captured, but Traveling was her discovery alone.  She has recovered
      some other abilities through Moghedien as well.  She plans to reunite
      the Tower and make it stronger than ever&mdash;and she plans to start by
      exiling Elaida, as she will not unite the Tower, only shatter it into
      fragments that will never be gathered up again.  <I>See also</I>

      She is the daughter of <A Href="#Bashere">Davram</A> and
      <A Href="#Deira">Deira</A> Bashere, their oldest surviving offspring.
      Her two older brothers were killed, and when Davram sent her younger
      brother off to fight while keeping her at home, she ran away and swore
      the oath of a Hunter of the Horn in Illian.  When she became a Hunter,
      she renounced her old name, Zarine, at first considering adopting the
      name &ldquo;Mandarb&rdquo;&mdash;she chose Faile when she found that
      <A Href="#Mandarb">Mandarb</A> was the name of <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>'s
      horse.  She fell in love with <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A> while
      on her search for the Horn, who told her that the Horn had been found.
      She was shocked, but even more so to find out that
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> was the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> and
      that both he and Perrin are <I>ta'veren</I>.  Faile stayed near Perrin,
      and finally accompanied him to the Two Rivers where she helped fend off
      the Trolloc attacks; the two were married shortly afterwards.  They were
      then proclaimed Lord and Lady of the Two Rivers.  Perrin hated the idea,
      but Faile insisted they have a modest estate, and even servants, which
      she trained herself.  Her name means &ldquo;falcon&rdquo; in the Old
      Tongue; she is the falcon in <A Href="#Min">Min</A>'s viewings of
      Perrin.  She is very protective of her blacksmith, and does whatever she
      can to make sure he not so much as <I>looks</I> at another woman, even
      though he has no intention of doing so.  She is a very jealous wife,
      especially toward people like <A Href="#Berelain">Berelain</A> who eye
      her husband all the time.  She even cornered <A Href="#Min">Min</A> when
      they first came to Caemlyn and Perrin greeted her warmly, to make sure
      Min had no intentions toward him.  She left with Perrin for Ghealdan to
      find <A Href="#Masema">Masema</A>, and while he was away her party was
      ambushed by the Shaido Aiel and she was taken <I>gai'shain</I> by them.
      She and the servants captured with her are planning an escape.  She is
      now a personal servant of <A Href="#Sevanna">Sevanna</A>, and she
      seems to be one of Sevanna's favorites.
