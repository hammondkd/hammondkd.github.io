  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Yulan">Abaldar Yulan</A>, p.
      44&mdash;Captain of the Air and pilot of a Seanchan <I>raken</I> for
      the Forerunners.  He is small and dark, and a general.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Abar">Abar</A>, p. 218&mdash;Lean Domani who
      performs in <A Href="#Luca">Valan Luca</A>'s show.  He and his brother
      <A Href="#Balat">Balat</A> eat fire and swallow swords; even
      <A Href="#Thom">Thom</A> admits that they are good at it.  After
      <A Href="#Leilwin">Leilwin</A> and <A Href="#Domon">Domon</A> were
      married, <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A> was forced to displace them from their
      tent.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Abelle">Abelle Pendar</A>, p. 371&mdash;Andoran
      noble, leader of a strong House that supported
      <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A> during the Succession.  Morgase exiled
      him from Caemlyn as per <A Href="#Gaebril">Gaebril</A>'s suggestion, but
      she hopes he will still support her when she comes to reclaim the
      throne.  <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> hopes he will support her claim to
      the throne.  He seems to disappear easily and at random, and for now he
      is effectively in hibernation from the point of view of Andoran
      politics.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Adela">Adela</A>, p. 187&mdash;One of
      <A Href="#Toke">Master Fearnim</A>'s stablehands.

      Sedai of the Brown Ajah, one of two Aes Sedai who went into voluntary
      retreat many years ago to Tifan's Well, a village located in the grassy
      plains of Arafel, along with her sister <A Href="#Vandene">Vandene</A>.
      Their goal was to someday write the complete history of the World since
      the Breaking, and some even before that.  <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A> cannot
      tell Adeleas and Vandene apart, even though they are not twins.  Adeleas
      was brutally murdered, along with <A Href="#Ispan">Ispan Shefar</A>, the
      Black Sister she was guarding at the time, by an unknown assassin.
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> has no doubt that Adeleas's killer is one
      or more of <A Href="#Merilille">Merilille Ceandevin</A>,
      <A Href="#Careane">Careane Fransi</A>, and
      <A Href="#Sareitha">Sareitha Tomares</A>.
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Vandene">Namelle, Vandene</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Adelorna">Adelorna Bastine</A>, p. 56&mdash;Short,
      slim, Saldaean Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah.  She is the Captain-General
      of the Green Ajah, the Ajah's leader.  She was once birched by
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>.  She chose <A Href="#Rina">Rina</A> for
      the Hall without a nominations process, which goes against Green custom.
      She has three Warders.  She is slim, and of a height with
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Admar">Admar</A>, p. 597&mdash;Officer in the
      Band of the Red Hand.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Adrielle">Adrielle</A>, p. 583&mdash;Aes Sedai of
      the Gray Ajah, bonded via the Warder-like Asha'man wife bond to
      <A Href="#Kurin">Kurin</A>.  She is very plain.  They are very
      affectionate to each other despite her plainness, his gray hair, and the
      fact that she was bonded against her will.  She is much taller than he.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aeldrine">Aeldrine Marinye</A>, p.
      122&mdash;Daughter of <A Href="#Collaris">Collaris</A>, mother of
      <A Href="#Beonin">Beonin</A>.  She became a dye merchant, and was very
      well-off.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aelmara">Aelmara</A>, p.
      479&mdash;<A Href="#Romanda">Romanda</A>'s servant.  She served Romanda

      shortly thereafter when Romanda was involved in a &ldquo;slight
      misunderstanding.&rdquo;
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aemlyn">Aemlyn Carand</A>, p. 371&mdash;Andoran
      lady, High Seat of a strong House that supported
      <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A> during the Succession.  Morgase exiled
      her from Caemlyn as per <A Href="#Gaebril">Gaebril</A>'s suggestion.
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> hopes that she will still support her, but
      for now she supports <A Href="#Dyelin">Dyelin</A> for the Throne.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Hausard">Afrim Hausard</A>, p. 359&mdash;Burly
      Guardsman who escorted <A Href="#Hark">Hark</A> to see
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>.  He served <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A>
      faithfully, and knows when to keep his mouth shut.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Saranche">Agardo Saranche</A>, p. 446&mdash;Lean,
      balding Tairen.  He has one of the lightest complexions you will ever
      find in a native Tairen.  He has dark eyes.  He operates an inn in the
      city.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Agelmar">Agelmar Jagad</A>, p.
      710&mdash;<A Href="#Easar">Easar</A>'s general in Shienar.  He is
      possibly the best military commander alive (excepting possibly
      <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>, the Aiel chiefs, and a few Seanchan commanders).
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aghan">Aghan</A>, p. 589&mdash;One of
      <A Href="#Bashere">Bashere</A>'s soldiers.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aginor">Aginor</A>, p. 142&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  During the Age of Legends, he was one of the foremost
      biologists of his time, specializing in genetics.  He went over to the
      Shadow because only there could he do all of the experiments he wanted
      to.  He was the one who created the Trollocs, Dragkhar, <I>gholam</I>,
      Darkhounds, and other Shadowspawn.  Some of the other Forsaken think he
      was insane, for only someone insane would create some of the creatures
      he did.  He was the second one to be released from the sealing on the
      Bore, after <A Href="#Balthamel">Balthamel</A>.  He was trapped close to
      the surface of the Bore, so he was not shielded from the passing of time
      very effectively; he emerged as a very old man, so old that his face was
      wrinkled so that one could barely make out his features anymore.  He was
      killed by <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> at the Eye of the World.  Unbeknownst
      to almost everyone (including the Forsaken), Aginor was reincarnated in
      the body of a Borderlander man and given the new name
      <A Href="#Osangar">Osan'gar</A>.  Osan'gar masqueraded as
      <A Href="#Dashiva">Corlan Dashiva</A>, one of the Asha'man, until he was
      killed at the cleansing of <I>saidin</I> by <A Href="#Elza">Elza
      Penfell</A> and her circle.  One of Aginor's creations was the
      <I>zomara</I>, androgynous not-quite-human servants; they are almost
      useless for any other task.  <A Href="#Arangar">Aran'gar</A> describes
      them as one of Aginor's &ldquo;less inspired creations.&rdquo;
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Dashiva">Dashiva, Corlan</A>;
      <A Href="#Osangar">Osan'gar</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Ailron">Ailron</A>, p. 302&mdash;King of Amadicia
      until the Seanchan invaded.  He was not as strong as most kings due to
      the control of the Children of the Light&mdash;in fact, he had almost no real
      power at all.  During the invasion, he took his army to engage the
      invaders near Jeramel; they were slaughtered, and Ailron himself was
      captured in what <A Href="#Valda">Valda</A> now calls &ldquo;Ailron's
      Disaster.&rdquo;  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Niall">Niall, Pedron</A>;
      <A Href="#Valda">Valda, Eamon</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aisling">Aisling Noon</A>, p.
      428&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah.  She served as advisor to
      <A Href="#Easar">King Easar</A> of Shienar until she disappeared when
      news of <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>'s rise to power arrived.  She has
      fierce eyes, and is fond of Borderland oaths that make
      <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A> wince.  She has bonded one of the Dedicated,
      <A Href="#Malevin">Arel Malevin</A>, as a Warder.  <I>See
      also</I> <A Href="#Easar">Togita, Easar</A>;
      <A Href="#Malevin">Malevin, Arel</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Ajimbura">Ajimbura</A>, p.
      705&mdash;<A Href="#Karede">Karede</A>'s manservant.  He is very
      protective of his master's honor; he recently killed someone over a mere
      insult.  He is thin and wiry, and has a habit of killing rats with his
      knife.
  <Li><A Class="name">Akein</A>, p. 227&mdash;<A Href="#Tuon">Tuon</A>'s
      horse.  She is a Domani razor, the rarest of breeds, and was a gift from
      <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Akoure">Akoure Vayet</A>, p. 60&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Gray Ajah.  She is stout, and was among those on the failed
      raiding party sent to capture the Asha'man, and was captured herself.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alainia">Alainia</A>, p. 608&mdash;Plump
      Amadician silversmith, now taken <I>gai'shain</I> by the Shaido.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alanna">Alanna Mosvani</A>, p. 445&mdash;Aes Sedai
      of the Green Ajah.  She is dark and slender with black hair and dark
      eyes.  She has two surviving Warders, <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> (whom she
      bonded against his will) and <A Href="#Ihvon">Ihvon</A>; her other,
      <A Href="#Owein">Owein</A>, died in the Two Rivers while scouting the
      Whitecloak camp.  She later found that bonding Rand was a grievious
      error; not only is it impossible to Compel him in comparison to most
      Warders (she compared it to attempting to uproot an oak tree with her
      bare hands), but she constantly feels the pain he experiences from the
      wound in his side, perhaps even more severely than he feels it.  She is
      now in Tear, but the other Aes Sedai there are avoiding her notice.

      <A Href="#Ihvon">Ihvon</A>; <A Href="#Owein">Owein</A>.

      of a company that attacked Caemlyn under
      <A Href="#Arymilla">Arymilla</A>.  He was killed by
      <A Href="#Birgitte">Birgitte</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aldin">Aldin</A>, p. 647&mdash;Tall, young,
      Amadician <I>gai'shain</I>.  He has square shoulders, and looks more a
      soldier than the bookkeeper he is.  He has taken a liking to
      <A Href="#Arrela">Arrela</A>, though she does not actually like men in
      that way.&hellip;
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Gomaisen">Aldred Gomaisen</A>, p. 351&mdash;Short,
      slender mercenary with the front of his head shaved.  He grew up in
      Cairhien, and is now in the pay of <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> in
      Andor.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aledrin">Aledrin</A>, p. 491&mdash;Sitter for the
      White Ajah in the new Hall.  She has dark, golden hair and big, pale
      brown eyes.  She grew up in Tarabon.  She is taller than most men, and
      plump.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Algarin">Algarin Pendaloan</A>, p.
      384&mdash;Lesser Lord of the Land in Tear.  He has a wrinkly face and a
      white beard.  He provided accomodations for <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>,
      <A Href="#Min">Min</A>, <A Href="#Verin">Verin</A>,
      <A Href="#Cadsuane">Cadsuane</A>, <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>,
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>, and the rest of their group on his manor
      so they could recuperate from the events at Shadar Logoth.  His younger
      brother <A Href="#Emarin">Emarin</A> could channel, and Algarin wants to
      be tested for the ability now as well.  While he is away at the Black
      Tower, Rand is using his estates in Tear to lay low for a while.
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Emarin">Pendaloan, Emarin</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alida">Alida Aldragoran</A>, p.
      437&mdash;Saldaean-born wife of <A Href="#Aldragoran">Weilin</A>.  Her
      husband is convinced that she would want to meet the wife of the
      uncrowned King of Malkier, even though she was Saldaean.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alise">Alise Tenjile</A>, p. 311&mdash;Operator of
      the Kin's farm.  She grew up in Tarabon.  She is quite formidable;
      <I>everyone</I> makes way for her, even some of the Aes Sedai.  She
      seems in her middle years.  She has a pleasant face and has touches of
      gray in her hair.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alivia">Alivia</A>, p. 385&mdash;Seanchan
      <I>damane</I> captured by Asha'man.  She was afraid of freedom because
      she feared being captured again.  She has been collared since she was
      thirteen or fourteen, and has been <I>damane</I> for over four hundred
      years.  She is considerably stronger in the One Power than
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>, and a little bit taller.  She has fine
      lines at the corners of her sharp blue eyes and white streaks in her
      blonde hair.  <A Href="#Min">Min</A> dislikes her, though not because of
      jealousy.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alliandre">Alliandre Maritha Kigarin</A>, p.
      76&mdash;Blessed of the Light, Queen of Ghealdan, Defender of Garen's
      Wall.  She is the fourth person to sit on the throne of Ghealdan in the
      past several months.  She wore jewelry to her meetings with
      <A Href="#Masema">Masema</A> for the sole purpose of giving it to him
      such that he would not ask for anything more; she also sent a letter
      to <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> offering him her friendship and asking for
      his help.  She was subsequently captured by the Shaido Aiel, and is now
      working with <A Href="#Faile">Faile</A> in an attempt to escape.
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Masema">Dagar, Masema</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Almandaragal">Almandaragal</A>, p.
      37&mdash;<A Href="#Suroth">Suroth</A>'s <I>lopar</I>.  He was given to
      her as a pup.  He is over ten feet tall and weighs over 2000&nbsp;pounds.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Mor">Almurat Mor</A>, p. 730&mdash;Seeker for the
      Truth among the Seanchan.  He believes there is a plot against
      <A Href="#Tuon">Tuon</A>, and is in the process of questioning just
      about everyone.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alsalam">Alsalam</A>, p. 391&mdash;King of Arad
      Doman.  He has been a good ruler for over twenty years, though the
      Council has recently smuggled him out of Bandar Eban&mdash;after leaving
      the city, he seems to have taken on the notion that he is the Rebirth
      of <A Href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alstaing">Alstaing</A>, p. 281&mdash;Taraboner
      present during <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>'s dice game.  She is interested in
      purchasing lacquerware from <A Href="#Camrin">Camrin</A> and
      <A Href="#Kostelle">Kostelle</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aludra">Aludra</A>, p. 181&mdash;Illuminator from
      Tarabon with dark waist-length hair done in thin braids, large dark
      eyes, and a plump mouth.  She was involved with the fireworks display
      for <A Href="#Galldrian">King Galldrian</A> of Cairhien that went awry
      when Trollocs came.  She was blamed for its failure, though she
      believed one of her colleagues, Tammuz, was to blame.  She was cast out
      of the Illuminators' Guild, and when she refused to stop practicing the
      art of making fireworks, several men tried to kill her.  She was saved
      by <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A> and <A Href="#Thom">Thom</A> in a barn, and as
      a sign of gratitude she gave Mat a roll of fireworks.  She later came to
      Ebou Dar, and asked Mat to find her a bellfounder.  He was knocked out
      during the battle and thus missed the bellfounder, but Aludra escaped
      and she now travles with Mat's entourage.  Since the Seanchan destroyed
      the Chapter House of the Illuminators in Tanchico, Aludra may be the
      last Illuminator alive.  <I>Note:  it is widely speculated that Aludra
      is looking for a bellfounder for a specific reason:  she wants to build
      a cannon.</I>
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</A>, p. 62&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the White Ajah, but secretly the head of the Black Ajah.  She
      was chosen to head the Black Ajah after the previous leader was killed
      by <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A> after she managed to kill off the
      <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A> without Ishamael's approval.
      Typical of most Whites, she has a very cool, collected personality.
      She served as <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A> under
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>, despite being of a different Ajah than
      Elaida was raised from.  Elaida was all but forced to choose Alviarin in
      order to gain the support of the White Ajah when bringing charges
      against <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A>; unknown to Elaida, this also brought
      her the support of the Black Ajah.  Without Alviarin as Keeper, the
      White Ajah would most likely have been divided over whether to depose
      Siuan, and only the Red would be behind Elaida, which would most likely
      have led to the stilling of Elaida and possibly even the dismantling of
      the Red Ajah.  It still may, since Elaida is rapidly losing her support
      among the sisters.  If Alviarin's loyalties are ever revealed, nothing
      will save either of them.  Alviarin has been shown how to Travel by
      <A Href="#Mesaana">Mesaana</A>, and one of her first uses of it brought
      her to Tremalking for several weeks, during which Elaida removed her as
      Keeper.  She appears to know that the Aes Sedai sent back from Salidar
      are spies; she refused to let Elaida speak with
      <A Href="#Meidani">Meidani</A>, who was one of them.  She has since been
      estranged from the White Ajah; her fellow Whites blame her for
      destroying their connection to the Amyrlin, and humiliating herself and
      her Ajah in the process.  She has since been sent to
      <A Href="#Silviana">Silviana</A> for daily beatings.  <I>See also</I>

      <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alvistere">Alvistere</A>, p. 504&mdash;Novice who
      trips <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> in the dining hall.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alvon">Alvon</A>, p. 175&mdash;Stock woodcutter
      taken <I>gai'shain</I> by the Shaido.  He has a son,
      <A Href="#Theril">Theril</A>.  Both have tried to run away three times.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alwhin">Alwhin</A>, p. 38&mdash;Voice of the
      Blood, formerly in service of <A Href="#Suroth">High Lady Suroth</A>.
      She is a glowering woman.  Originally a <I>sul'dam</I>, she
      was intended to be the Leash Holder for <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>
      when she and <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> were given to Suroth by

      killed by Liandrin by poison, which caused her eyes to bulge and her
      face to turn blue before the end.  Liandrin killed her because she
      thought she could curry favor with Suroth by doing so.  Suroth was not

      p. 220&mdash;Former Panarch of Tarabon.  She vanished, allegedly at

      was being held prisoner by sisters of the Black Ajah under
      <A Href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</A>, and was rescued by
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> and <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>.  They
      had her keep a low profile for several days so as not to be hurt by the

      &ldquo;The Panarch is dead!&rdquo; to &ldquo;Death to the
      Panarch!&rdquo;), then she returned to her position.  When the Seanchan
      invaded Tanchico, she refused to willingly give her country to the new
      conquerors; they captured her, and forced her to live as a servant.  She
      served as a dancer for <A Href="#Suroth">High Lady Suroth</A>, the

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>, p. 47&mdash;The leader
      of the Aes Sedai, their equivalent of a King or Queen.  She in theory
      holds supreme power amongst the sisters, and leads the Hall of the Tower
      at its meetings.  Kings and queens of nations strong and weak will come
      if summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their entire trip
      figuring out how they will put a knife in her back while there.  The
      Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in
      her character.  The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must
      the vote to depose one.  Once chosen, the Amyrlin is said to be
      &ldquo;of all Ajahs and none&ldquo;&mdash;all previous affiliations with
      Ajah are ignored (at least in theory).  The Ajahs have gotten fairly
      equal numbers of Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions.
      No Amyrlin had been raised from the Red Ajah since
      <A Href="../book5/alphalast.html#Bonwhin">Bonwhin Meraighdin</A>, who
      was deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in
      <A Href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</A>'s day, except for
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</A>, the current Amyrlin
      Seat in Tar Valon; the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of
      Amyrlins from its Ajah&mdash;four of the last the last five Amyrlins
      (before Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah.  These two exceptions to
      the mean number of Amyrlins from one's Ajah have only added to the
      friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years.  The Amyrlin has
      a secretary of sorts, the <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the
      Chronicles</A>, who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the
      Amyrlin was raised from.  The Amyrlin Seat was held by
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>, raised from the Blue Ajah, until she
      was deposed for her involvement with events surrounding the
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  Her successor was the leader of
      the coup, <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</A>, raised from
      the Red Ajah.  Siuan's deposition divided the Tower, and the faction
      opposing Elaida raised a new Amyrlin who could not be accused of
      choosing sides on the fateful day Siuan was deposed:
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A>, who was outside the Tower and not

      could Break the World beyond repair.  He went there to obtain the male

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aviendha">Aviendha</A>, p. 310&mdash;Aiel of the
      Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel.  Formerly a Maiden of the Spear,
      she was forced to give up the spear to become a Wise One because she had
      the ability to channel inborn.  She has green eyes, and is of age with
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> and <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>.  She is more than
      pretty with her dark reddish hair.  Aviendha is one of the three women
      in <A Href="#Min">Min</A>'s viewing of Rand&mdash;she also saw that she was
      to fall in love with him when she went through the three rings in
      Rhuidean.  She denied her feelings for him at first, but when the
      wagons crossed the Dragonwall toward Cairhien, sweat tents became
      unavailable and she tried bathing as &ldquo;wetlanders&rdquo; did; Rand
      came in as she was standing before the bath in her skin, and she
      panicked.  She created a Traveling gateway to northern Seanchan (she
      does not remember how), trying to get as far away from Rand as possible,
      into the middle of winter.  When Rand rescued her, she decided she could
      not hide her feelings any longer, and the two ended up spending the
      night in each other's arms before coming back.  Aviendha says a similar
      incident will not occur, and punished any Maiden who made a crack about
      it (how they found out about something that occurred on the far side of
      the world on another continent is a different subject entirely).  She
      felt <I>toh</I> toward <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> for violating her
      trust, but upon hearing that Elayne would consent to being her
      sister-wife, Aviendha felt empowered to show her feelings for Rand once
      again.  She is not certain what she thinks of a <I>second</I>
      sister-wife in Min, but she seems to accept the idea at least.  She has
      been having trouble learning Traveling again; the way Elayne forms the
      weave is different from how she used it to get to Seanchan, and it is
      difficult to learn something once you already learned it another way.
      She has, however, mastered the art of untying weaves&mdash;a feat which
      was thought impossible by all Aes Sedai, as well as the Forsaken.  She
      and Elayne have adopted each other as first-sisters.  Aviendha has a
      special ability in making wards against eavesdropping; it is unlikely
      even the Forsaken could breach one of her wards, and certainly no one
      could do so without her knowing it immediately.  <I>See also</I>

      she was carrying around her neck, hoping to use it as one more barrier
      to the woman fleeing (since Bethamin supposedly cannot channel, the

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Cabriana">Cabriana Mecandes</A>, p.
      484&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah who
      <A Href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</A> tortured (along with her Warder) in
      order to extract information from her about the Aes Sedai and the White
      Tower.  Her identity was used to give <A Href="#Halima">Halima</A> a
      reason to know things about Aes Sedai, since she claimed to be her
      servant.  She was one of three sisters referred to by Blues as The
      Three because they were so close.  The other two were
      <A Href="#Anaiya">Anaiya</A> and <A Href="#Kairen">Kairen</A>.  The
      Three <Em>never</Em> talked of affairs except with eachother.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Cadsuane">Cadsuane Melaidhrin</A>, p.
      203&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah with iron-gray hair.  She retired
      to a rose garden in northern Ghealdan, but has since left it due to the
      difficulty of growing decent roses with the weather the way it used to
      be.  She refused two appointments to the Hall of the Tower, when
      refusing even once is unheard of.  She also refused to become head of
      the Green Ajah.  It is said that she has had more Warders than most
      sisters have had shoes.  She has more strength than anyone in a thousand
      years except perhaps for <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> and
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>.  Although she is a Green, she has
      confronted and captured more men that can channel than any other woman;
      unknown to most, the men she captures tend to live longer after being
      gentled than the average.  She is somewhat of a living legend among Aes
      Sedai.  According to <A Href="#Min">Min</A>, Cadsuane will teach
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> and the Asha'man something&mdash;they will not
      like it, especially not from her, but they will have to learn it.  She
      is the oldest Aes Sedai alive.  Cadsuane wears many ornaments in her
      hair, all of which are <I>ter'angreal</I> she has collected over the
      years.  One of them is a reservoir&mdash;it &ldquo;stores&rdquo;
      <I>saidar</I> for later use in places where one might not be able to tap
      the Source, such as inside an Ogier <I>stedding</I> or inside Far
      Madding, her hometown.  Another vibrates in the presence of men who can
      channel; it is likely this ornament that has allowed her to capture so
      many men to be gentled.  There are many others, including three that she
      does not know the purpose of.  <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A> suspects
      Cadsuane may be a Darkfriend, but based on her actions and thoughts so
      far that seems unlikely.  <A Href="#Verin">Verin</A> told rand that she
      thinks Cadsuane can be trusted, and Verin is also not a Darkfriend.
      Cadsuane has, reluctantly, agreed to be Rand's advisor, provided he

      <A Href="#Creator">The Creator</A> in every way.  At the moment of
      Creation, Shai'tan was imprisoned by the Creator at Shayol Ghul.  This
      prison kept him from touching the world until it was bored into by Aes
      Sedai during the Age of Legends.  This hole, called the Bore, allowed
      the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new outbreaks of
      war, treachery, violence, and crime.  The attempt to free the Dark One
      completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the War of Power by
      some, especially those on the Shadow's side), during which a number of
      important leaders forsook the Light and gave their lives to the Dark
      One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of the
      most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  The War of the Shadow
      did not end until <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A>, the
      <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>, and his Hundred Companions Traveled to
      Shayol Ghul and re-sealed the Dark One back into his prison, trapping
      the Forsaken with him.  At the moment of sealing, Shai'tan lashed out at
      those sealing the prison, driving them insane and tainting <I>saidin</I>
      itself, the male half of the True Source, dooming all male Aes Sedai to
      madness as well and starting the Time of Madness.  These seals are
      weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the Dark One is
      once again able to exert influence on the world.  These seals were
      scattered throughout the world by Aes Sedai during the Breaking of the
      World.  In order of when they were discovered, they were found:  1) At
      the Eye of the World (broken when it was found); 2) in the hands of
      <A Href="#Domon">Bayle Domon</A>, later pilfered by
      <A Href="#Turak">High Lord Turak</A> of the Seanchan (broken at the
      battle of Falme), 3) On Seanchan, part of High Lord Turak's collection
      (broken at the battle at Falme); 4) In the Great Hold at the Stone of
      Tear (still intact); 5) In the Panarch's Palace in Tanchico (broken
      enroute to Salidar); 6) One in Rhuidean (still intact), and 7) Found by
      <A Href="#Taim">Mazrim Taim</A> on a small farm in Saldaea (still
      intact).  Despite being made of <I>cuendillar</I>, the three that remain
      unbroken can be cut with a knife and would break by a fall from a table.

      proceeded to almost equal Lews Therin's accomplishments, almost equal
      Lews Therin's strength, and almost equal him but never surpass him in
      everything.  He became one of the Light's greatest generals, once again
      second in command under Lews Therin.  Demandred believed that he was
      Lews Therin's intellectual and military superior, and was furious when
      Lews Therin was chosen to lead the Light's forces over him during the
      War of the Shadow.  He developed a burning hatred of Lews Therin, and
      finally dedicated his life to the Shadow so he could finally better Lews
      Therin&mdash;he believed the Shadow would eventually win the war since
      Lews Therin was commanding the Light's armies, and that if he, Barid Bel
      Medar, had been chosen to command them, the Light would have prevailed.
      When Demandred was freed from the Bore, he transferred his hatred of
      Lews Therin intact to the new recipient of his soul,

      after the act, but it is not known whether this was set up, or whether
      Valda just happened to be in the right place at the right time.  One of
      his first acts was to dismiss Niall's secretary,
      <A Href="#Balwer">Sebban Balwer</A>, for &ldquo;someone who didn't
      twitch.&rdquo;  This was a mistake, as Balwer was Niall's
      <I>true</I> Master of Spies&mdash;he knows more about spying than
      anyone else in the world.  Valda offered assistance to
      <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A>, as Niall had promised, but before doing
      so he required a &ldquo;service&rdquo; of her:  to share his bed.
      Morgase escaped during the Seanchan attack, and Valda believes her to be
      dead.  He has since fallen into disfavor with the Children of the Light,
      most especially with <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A>, because of his dealings
      with Morgase; Galad because she is his stepmother, and with the other

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A>, p. 82&mdash;Young
      woman from Emond's Field, now raised to the <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin
      Seat</A> among the Aes Sedai opposing <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>.  She
      has considerable strength with the One Power, and will most likely be
      one of the strongest Aes Sedai in over a thousand years.  She is also
      the first Dreamer in the Tower in almost 500 years; she trained with the
      Wise Ones to learn more of this Talent.  Egwene is good friends with
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</A>, the Daughter-Heir of Andor, and is
      also a childhood friend of <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, the
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  In fact, Rand and Egwene were all
      but Promised in their youth, but both of them feel an almost
      sibling-like love for each other now; they know that they cannot get
      married, and do not want to.  Egwene is the love object of both of
      Elayne's brothers, <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A> and
      <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>&mdash;she is flattered by Galad's attentions,
      but she does not return them; she does find Gawyn to her liking, and had
      a dream of bonding him as her Warder; she knows it will occur.  Egwene
      was most likely chosen Amyrlin because she was in the Aiel Waste when
      the rebellion occurred, and because the Aes Sedai thought she could be
      guided by them without too much trouble; if this was their intent, they
      made a grave mistake, for Egwene promises to be one of the strongest
      Amyrlins in history.  Egwene has enlisted <A Href="#Bryne">Gareth
      Bryne</A> as the commander of her army to invade Tar Valon and remove
      Elaida from power.  She has also opened the novice books to all
      interested women for the first time in history&mdash;in the past, they
      were only open to girls of a certain age, for fear that older women
      would not be able to handle the discipline.  This policy has increased
      the size of the rebel Tower to several times the size of the original,
      unified one.  The number of novices has increased to levels not known
      for over a thousand years.  Egwene has also discovered many lost Talents
      of the Age of Legends, such as Dreaming, Traveling, and the making of
      <I>cuendillar</I>.  She was guided to Dreaming by the Wise Ones, with
      whom she studied in the Aiel Waste, and was guided to the making of
      <I>cuendillar</I> by <A Href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</A> while she was
      captured, but Traveling was her discovery alone.  She has recovered
      some other abilities through Moghedien as well.  She plans to reunite
      the Tower and make it stronger than ever&mdash;and she plans to start by
      exiling Elaida, as she will not unite the Tower, only shatter it into
      fragments that will never be gathered up again.  <I>See also</I>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</A>, p.
      39&mdash;Aes Sedai formerly of the Red Ajah, now raised to the
      <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A> in Tar Valon.  She was born the
      youngest daughter of a minor House in the north of Murandy.  She
      occasionally has the Foretelling, and as a result of a Foretelling she
      had concerning the importance of the Royal Family of Andor in Tarmon
      Gaidon, she served as advisor to <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A> of
      Andor for her entire reign.  She later led the coup that deposed
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> and placed her on the Amyrlin Seat in
      Siuan's place.  She distrusts anyone not of the Red Ajah (as most Reds
      do), and does not think she will ever be able to trust any member of the
      Blue Ajah again.  Her <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A> was
      <A Href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</A> of the White Ajah&mdash;she
      was all but forced to choose Alviarin due to her role in the deposition
      of Siuan.  If she chose a Keeper from her Ajah, she most likely would
      not have won the support of the White Ajah, and then <I>she</I> would
      have been stilled and banished from the Tower instead of
      Siuan.  Her Foretelling about the importance of Andor's royal family
      during the Last Battle occurred around the time the Succession was going
      on, so she immediately attached herself to Morgase as soon as it became
      clear that she would be the one to take the Lion Throne.  Another of her
      Foretellings was to predict that <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> would
      shake the world on its very foundations&mdash;she constantly kicks herself
      for not doing something about him when he was right in front of her,
      little more than a farmboy at the time.  Her most recent Foretelling was
      that &ldquo;the White Tower would be whole again, except for remnants
      cast out and scorned, whole and stronger than ever.
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> will face the Amyrlin Seat and know her
      anger.  The Black Tower will be rent in blood and fire, and sisters will
      walk its grounds.&rdquo;  The Foretelling about Rand is obviously deadly
      accurate.  However, the one about the Royal Family occurred at an
      inopportune time; at the time of Elaida's Foretelling, the Royal Family
      was not certain.  It may have meant Morgase,
      <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>, <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A>, and
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> (they have all had a large role to play in
      the recent past), but it is also possible it could have meant the old
      Royal Family, that of <A Href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</A>,
      <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail</A>, Galad, and later Elayne and Gawyn as
      well.  After all, Morgase is just Morgase, but Tigraine is the mother of
      the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  Her most recent Foretelling
      will of course be fulfilled, but not necessarily how she wants it to be;
      she does not realize that the Amyrlin Seat in the Foretelling might not
      be her, that the remnants cast out might be those loyal to her, and that
      the destruction of the Black Tower might have nothing to do with her.
      Elaida is quite strong in the One Power; only Siuan (before she was
      still and Healed), <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>,
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>, <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>,
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>, and a few others could match her
      strength.  Elaida has always sought positions of power; she chose to
      follow Morgase to have a better chance at guiding the forces in the Last
      Battle, and tried to capture Rand al'Thor in an effort to gain similar
      control.  The only sisters that support her are those that are actually
      Black Ajah and those that would follow any Amyrlin legally raised, as
      Elaida was (although just barely; all laws used to raise her were
      stretched almost to their breaking point, and some believe they actually
      <I>did</I> shatter).  Elaida is currently building a palace for herself
      atop the Warders' old practice yard.  The building will be about as tall
      as the White Tower.  She has no plans on being merciful on those who
      rebelled against her when she deposed Siuan&mdash;her terms are that the
      Blue Ajah no longer exists, and that any sister following Egwene must
      serve penance under her personal guidance before being readmitted to the
      Tower.  Elaida has since replaced Alviarin as Keeper with a sister of
      the Red Ajah, <A Href="#Tarna">Tarna</A>, and she has suspicions that
      Alviarin was trying to commit treason against the Tower.  <I>See also</I>

      135&mdash;Daughter-Heir of Andor, now Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah.  She
      is the daughter of <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A> and her late husband,
      <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail</A>, and sister to
      <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>.  She is also half-sister to
      <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A>, although she would rather not be reminded of
      this fact; she thinks Galad virtuous to the point of fault, and does not
      really like him.  She has considerable potential in the One Power, and
      is one of the strongest Aes Sedai in a thousand years or more,
      possibly since the Age of Legends, with the exceptions of
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>, <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>,
      <A Href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</A>, and some trainees.  She has
      red-gold curly hair.  During her stay in the Stone of Tear, Elayne
      realized she loved <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, and told him how
      she felt; he felt similarly.  She had no idea at the time what
      <A Href="#Min">Min</A> meant about &ldquo;having to share him,&rdquo;
      but now knows about Min's viewing of Rand with the three women's heads,
      indicating that Rand will fall in love with Min, Elayne, and Aviendha,
      and they with him.  Later, when she and Nynaeve had trouble with
      <A Href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</A>, Elayne ended up bonding
      <A Href="#Birgitte">Birgitte</A> as her Warder (despite being only
      Accepted at the time) in order to save Birgitte's life.  Elayne later
      went to Ebou Dar and found the Bowl of the Winds, a <I>ter'angreal</I>
      that they used to fix the weather.  She has since returned to Andor upon
      hearing news of her mother's disappearance; she plans to take the Lion
      Throne, as soon as she has garnered enough support to keep it.  In the
      meantime, Elayne has managed to reproduce several <I>ter'angreal</I>,
      something which no one else has been able to do since the Breaking of
      the World, as well as discover a way to share a Warder bond between
      three women; she bonded Rand along with Aviendha, her new sister by Aiel
      tradition, and Min.  Shortly after bonding Rand, she became pregnant
      with Rand's twins.  To protect the children, she is not revealing the
      father of the twins.  She is proving to be a capable leader, one her
      people may eventually be proud of.  <I>See also</I>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Min">Elmindreda (Min) Farshaw</A>, p.
      105&mdash;Young woman from Baerlon.  She has a special ability that few
      besides herself know about:  she sees images and auras around people,
      especially around Aes Sedai, Warders, and Asha'man, that foretell their
      futures.  Min does not always know what these viewings mean, but when
      she does, it <I>will</I> happen; it is only a question of how and when.
      Min was fascinated by the number of images she saw around
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>, especially the one she saw that included
      herself:  he was destined to fall in love with three different women,
      one of which was herself.  She usually dresses in attire reserved for
      men; this habit was picked up when growing up with her father, who was a
      miner.  However, once she started to develop feelings for Rand, she
      began to wear more traditionally feminine attire.  Min was in Tar Valon
      helping <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A> with her viewings' information when
      Siuan was deposed, and it was Min that freed Siuan and
      <A Href="#Leane">Leane</A> from the dungeon.  She accompanied the two
      former leaders of the Aes Sedai to Salidar; once there, she left for
      Caemlyn with Salidar's embassy to Rand.  Once in Caemlyn, she brought
      information to Rand about the embassy there, and its intentions.  She
      has only had one viewing that ever failed, which concerned
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>; since Moiraine is believed dead, she

      <A Href="#Deira">Deira</A> Bashere, their oldest surviving offspring.
      Her two older brothers were killed, and when Davram sent her younger
      brother off to fight while keeping her at home, she ran away and swore
      the oath of a Hunter of the Horn in Illian.  When she became a Hunter,
      she renounced her old name, Zarine, at first considering adopting the
      name &ldquo;Mandarb&rdquo;&mdash;she chose Faile when she found that
      <A Href="#Mandarb">Mandarb</A> was the name of <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>'s
      horse.  She fell in love with <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A> while
      on her search for the Horn, who told her that the Horn had been found.
      She was shocked, but even more so to find out that
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> was the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> and
      that both he and Perrin are <I>ta'veren</I>.  Faile stayed near Perrin,
      and finally accompanied him to the Two Rivers where she helped fend off
      the Trolloc attacks; the two were married shortly afterwards.  They were
      then proclaimed Lord and Lady of the Two Rivers.  Perrin hated the idea,
      but Faile insisted they have a modest estate, and even servants, which
      she trained herself.  Her name means &ldquo;falcon&rdquo; in the Old
      Tongue; she is the falcon in <A Href="#Min">Min</A>'s viewings of
      Perrin.  She is very protective of her blacksmith, and does whatever she
      can to make sure he not so much as <I>looks</I> at another woman, even
      though he has no intention of doing so.  She is a very jealous wife,
      especially toward people like <A Href="#Berelain">Berelain</A> who eye
      her husband all the time.  She even cornered <A Href="#Min">Min</A> when
      they first came to Caemlyn and Perrin greeted her warmly, to make sure
      Min had no intentions toward him.  She left with Perrin for Ghealdan to
      find <A Href="#Masema">Masema</A>, and while he was away her party was
      ambushed by the Shaido Aiel and she was taken <I>gai'shain</I> by them.

      now a personal servant of <A Href="#Sevanna">Sevanna</A>, and she
      seems to be one of Sevanna's favorites&mdash;for both service and

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Bryne">Gareth Bryne</A>, p. 21&mdash;Former First
      Prince of the Sword and Captain of the Queen's Guards under
      <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A> in Andor.  He was appointed to the
      position because Morgase had no living male relatives, but was exiled
      from Caemlyn on a suggestion from Morgase's new advisor,
      <A Href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</A>.  He moved to his private estates in
      rural Andor, where he presided over the trial of three young women who
      unintentionally burned a barn: they turned out to be
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>, the former <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin
      Seat</A>; <A Href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</A>, the former
      <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A>, and
      <A Href="#Min">Min Farshaw</A>.  When these three made an oath to serve
      him and then apparently broke it, he followed them out of sheer
      curiosity to Salidar.  Once there, he discovered the true identity of
      the three, as well as that the Tower was truly broken.  The Aes Sedai in
      Salidar persuaded him to command the army they would need to take the
      Amyrlin Seat from <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>, since he was the only
      commander that the Warders thought would be willing and able to help
      them.  He is one of the six best military commanders west of the Aiel
      Waste, in a league with <A Href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</A>,
      <A Href="#Rodel">Rodel Ituralde</A>, <A Href="#Bashere">Davram
      Bashere</A>, <A Href="#Agelmar">Agelmar Jagad</A>, and
      <A Href="#Mat">Matrim Cauthon</A>.  Although neither of them would admit
      it, Bryne seems to be developing feelings for Siuan Sanche; he wishes to
      avoid another mistake like his relationship as
      <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A>'s lover, and also never forgave Siuan for
      when she publicly shamed him years ago.  She seems to be developing
      similar feelings for him, much to her dismay.  He planned to be the
      first general to take the city of Tar Valon; the closest anyone else
      ever came was with <A Href="#Guaire">Guaire Amalasan</A>'s armies, who
      got as far as the White Tower itself, and <A Href="#Hawkwing">Artur
      Hawkwing</A>, who never managed to go beyond beseiging the city.
      Actually, Amalasan's troops never beseiged the city, they simply managed
      to breech the walls; Hawkwing never managed to stop the supply ships
      coming up the river.  Bryne thought he will be able to overcome this
      problem by purchasing ships along the way to Tar Valon, but when
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> brought the entire army to Tar Valon by
      Traveling, that plan faltered; instead, he is pressuring her to let him
      use gateways to breach the walls and get inside the city.  He is stocky,
      with a bluff face.  The years have given him some sort of comforting
      calmness.  Men always follow him&mdash;they have learned from history
      that doing so is the path to military victory.  Bryne taught
      <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A> and <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A> to practice
      the sword with both hands alternating to avoid weakness.

      when Elayne becomes Queen.  He and his half-brother
      <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A> went to train with the Warders in the White
      Tower, as all sons of Andoran queens have for centuries, and both now
      possess considerable skill with the sword.  During the chaos that
      erupted after <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>'s deposition, Gawyn
      formed a band of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders
      except Galad, who are called the Younglings.  The Younglings fought back
      against their teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and
      <A Href="#Leane">Leane</A> from their imprisonment.  Gawyn himself
      killed Hammar and Coulin, the men in charge of teaching the sword and
      for his personal training, respectively, both of which were
      Blademasters&mdash;few Warders are as good as they were, and Gawyn
      managed to kill both of them.  With recent developments, Gawyn does not
      know which party to support&mdash;he believes that anyone who opposed
      Tower Law by trying to free Siuan and Leane was wrong, but at the same
      time he does not know all the facts surrounding the change in
      leadership.  In fact, his sister Elayne and her friends

      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A> side with those

      their new leader.  He believes the rumor that <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>
      killed his mother, and only refrains from killing him because Egwene
      made him promise not to.  Gawyn has made many enemies inside and outside
      the Tower, just by leading the Younglings.  He detests Rand because he
      thinks Rand killed his mother (when in fact no one did), and there is no
      telling how he'll react when he finds out that Elayne actually does love
      him (and is carrying his twins), as well as that Egwene heads the

      Before the War of the Shadow, she became the leading authority on

      insane, schizophrenic, and others well beyond the touch of Healing.  She
      was the best at subtle manipulations of the human mind that ever lived.
      After the Bore was drilled, she went through a change after she realized
      the world could never live up to her standards.  So she began dressing
      in the very way she once mocked, with low cut dresses that clung to her
      and left little to the imagination.  After being released from the Bore,
      Graendal took up residence in Arad Doman, capturing several members of
      the Royal Family to use as servants.  All of her servants are not only
      physically well shaped and good-looking, but also had power in their
      society before she captured them.  She includes in her collection the

      Healing that might have saved his life, sending the Trollocs out of the
      Great Blight during the Trolloc Wars, and many other events in history
      that turned out poorly.  When the rest of the Forsaken were freed,
      Ishamael kept them away from eachother's throats.  He confronted
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> at the Eye of the World where he was severed

      much past twenty that had the spark of <I>saidin</I> inborn.  He is now
      one of the Asha'man.  He is loyal to <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>, not
      <A Href="#Taim">Taim</A>.  After being placed on the Traitor's List, he
      went in to hiding&mdash;he did not assist in the attack on Rand, but
      Rand thought it better to be safe than have him killed.  He has since
      been bonded as a Warder by <A Href="#Merise">Merise</A>.  He wielded
      <I>Callandor</I> at the cleansing of <I>saidin</I>, though the circle
      was controlled by one of the women.  Merise took away his dragon pin at
      first, claiming it was not appropriate for him to wear it in lieu of his
      new responsibilites as her Warder&mdash;Jahar was very angry with her
      for this, and she will eventually have to learn that he is much stronger
      than she is, and she needs to give him respect appropriate to that
      position.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Merise">Merise</A>

      <A Href="#Baal">Ba'alzamon's</A> scheming, and he escaped to the Ogier
      <I>stedding</I> and was never heard from again.  He is quite likely
      posing as <A Href="#Noal">Noal Charin</A>, a member of the party

      and his wife have been exiled, and now support
      <A Href="#Arymilla">Arymilla</A>'s claim to the Lion Throne, but if
      Elenia attempts to claim the throne for herself, Elayne expects him to

      Captain of the White Tower Guard.  <A Href="#Alviarin">Alviarin</A>
      suggested that they order him to increase his recruitment efforts to

      Ghealdan when <A Href="#Masema">Masema</A> started gathering followers.
      He considered Masema to be a harmless madman and did nothing

      accident, although <A Href="#Uno">Uno</A> claimed that unless Johanin
      did not know one end of a boar spear from another, he was killed by the

      twenty years, making them ideal for the task&mdash;they are used to long
      journeys with little rest.  She has since been sent with

      Seat</A>.  The Keeper is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah the
      Amyrlin was raised from, and wears a stole of the color of her Ajah
      instead of the striped stole of the Amyrlin.  The post was held by
      <A Href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</A> of the Blue Ajah until a coup deposed
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> and stilled both Siuan and Leane.  Her
      successor was <A Href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</A>
      of the White Ajah, despite the fact that Siuan's successor was from the
      Red.  The Keeper for the Aes Sedai who fled the Tower when

      Chronicles of their own, <A Href="#Sheriam">Sheriam Bayanar</A> of the

      and speaks for the Amyrlin; she is all but separate from her Ajah,
      although less so than the Amyrlin Seat herself.  However, both of the
      current Keepers have tried to expand their powers over the Amyrlin they
      serve, although for vastly different reasons&mdash;Alviarin is essentially
      trying to weaken Elaida and have herself or another Black sister raised
      in her place after Elaida is deposed; Sheriam tries to overstep
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> because she has a hard time thinking of
      Egwene being anything more than the frightened novice that came to her
      study not so long ago.  Alviarin has since been deposed and replaced by

      because of this was chosen to hold <A Href="#Ispan">Ispan Shefar</A>'s

      uncrowned king of Malkier, and formerly Warder to

      very emotional&mdash;in fact, he has emotional walls all around him that
      he has been building for years.  His country, Malkier, was overrun by
      Trollocs shortly after he was born, and is now corrupted by the Great
      Blight.  Lan, among the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a
      one-man war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight.  He
      fought Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status.  He
      was eventually bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at
      least changed its style).  When Lan and Moiraine brought
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>, <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>,
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A>, <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>, and
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> out of their home in the Two Rivers, he
      found that there was something which could throw his guard down, but he
      was the last to notice it:  affection for Nynaeve.  As Moiraine put it,
      Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan's emotional walls and break them
      down without him even knowing they were there.  The two of them are now
      married.  According to the terms of their vows as taken before the Sea
      Folk, one of them must obey in public while the other obeys in private;
      for obvious reasons, Nynaeve is the one who commands in public.
      Upon Moiraine's death, Lan's bond was immediately transferred
      to <A Href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</A> until Nynaeve is ready to have his
      bond transferred to her.  Myrelle tried to keep Lan's status secret, but
      she was given away when she tried to buy one of Lan's favorite foods,
      coin peppers, too far south (they are very popular in Shienar, and were
      in Malkier before it fell to the Blight, but do not grow well in
      southern climates).  Upon learning of where Lan was,
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> sent him to Ebou Dar to serve as a Warder
      for Nynaeve.  He now travels with his wife and the group of Aes Sedai

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Lanfear">Lanfear</A>, p. 143&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  Unlike the rest of the Forsaken, she chose her name for
      herself, which means &ldquo;Daughter of the Night&rdquo; in the Old
      Tongue.  She was born <A Href="#Mierin">Mierin Eronaile</A>, and was
      very strong in the One Power.  She worked at the Collam Daan, the
      primary facility for research into the One Power.  Her final discovery
      there was what she thought was a new source for the One Power, one that
      could be harnessed by men and women alike&mdash;this source turned out
      to be the emissions through a thin spot in the Pattern from the
      <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>'s prison.  She and another Aes Sedai named
      Beidomon bored into the prison, creating what is now referred to as
      simply the Bore, allowing the Dark One to touch the world again and
      leading to the War of the Shadow.  Around this time, Mierin formed a
      relationship with <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A>, who headed
      the forces of the Light against the Shadow and was the most powerful man
      she had found.  Lews Therin broke off the relationship when he found
      that she only wanted him for his power and authority and the possibility
      of power for herself through him.  Mierin never let go of him, and when
      he later met and married <A Href="#Ilyena">Ilyena Moerelle</A>, she
      tried to disrupt the wedding ceremony as well as split the two apart by
      any means.  Eventually she went to Shayol Ghul to dedicate her soul to
      the Shadow, most likely to finally get back at Lews Therin for leaving
      her.  She declared as her territory the World of Dreams,
      <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>, using it to ends now unknown.  She transferred
      her obsessive love intact to Lews Therin's soul's new body,
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, after being freed from the Bore.  She
      first appeared to him as a young woman named Selene, but disguised her
      appearance as a slightly less beautiful (but still stunning) woman.
      Almost a year later, Lanfear found that Rand had been
      &ldquo;unfaithful&rdquo; to her, and she tried to kill him.  Before she
      could, she was pushed through the twisted stone doorway
      <I>ter'angreal</I> leading to the lands of the Eelfinn by
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>, becoming trapped.  Lanfear has since

      the Green Ajah.  She grew up in Arad Doman, and has coppery skin.  Just
      as her family members were training her in the seductive ways of Domani
      women, Leane found that her life would take a different direction:  she
      could channel <I>saidar</I>, and would do so with or without teaching.
      She became an Aes Sedai, a member of the Blue Ajah, and was eventually
      raised to <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A> under
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>.  During the coup
      led by <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida a'Roihan</A> and
      <A Href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</A> that deposed Siuan, Leane was
      thrown in the dungeon and stilled.  Leane tried turning to her seductive
      side to try to replace what she lost in stilling; she was out of
      practice, but did well enough.  She eventually convinced the Aes Sedai
      in Salidar to let her stay with them and maintain the network of
      eyes-and-ears she kept in Tar Valon as Keeper.  She was later Healed by
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>, and restored to some of her former
      capacity for using the One Power.  The Hall of the Tower in Salidar
      decided that since she had been stilled, she was no longer Aes Sedai for
      that time and thus all of her titles and choice of Ajah were null and
      void.  Instead of petitioning to re-enter the Blue Ajah, she asked the
      Green Ajah if it would accept her; it did, and she became the first
      sister to ever switch Ajahs.  Her eyes-and-ears as Keeper are retained
      by her; she was the only Aes Sedai to plant spies in the city itself.
      These spies are very useful in determining both what is going on in Tar
      Valon, but also what the Ajahs are leaving out of their reports to

      against the Forsaken, and led the final stroke which re-sealed the
      <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A> back into his prison.  Unfortunately,
      during this stroke he was driven insane by the Dark One's touch,
      eventually killing his wife <A Href="#Ilyena">Ilyena</A>, his children,
      and everyone he loved, as well as anyone who carried a drop of his
      blood.  For this act, people remember him with a new name:

      <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A> gave him his sanity back long enough
      for him to realize what he had done; Lews Therin killed himself by
      drawing on <I>saidin</I> too heavily, causing a mountain to form on the
      spot where he stood.  This mountain is called Dragonmount, and is near
      the present-day city of Tar Valon.  It is unfortunate that the name of
      one of the greatest men to ever live is now synonymous with evil, for
      Lews Therin killed his family due to the Dark One's influence, but
      without Lews Therin there may not have been a world left in which to
      kill them.  Lews Therin's voice often speaks inside
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s head, offering advice or sobbing over lost
      women or ranting about killing men who can channel.  It even tries to

      information that indicated that the Red Ajah actually put him up to
      declaring himself the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>, most likely
      with the pretext that bringing down a false Dragon would bring more
      glory than gentling a simple man who could channel.  Logain was recently

      came to the Black Tower to attempted to capture the Asha'man (not

      friends, <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> and <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin
      Aybara</A>, he left home to escape the Trolloc attacks after
      Winternight.  On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger from Shadar
      Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which he carried
      with him for a long time.  He was separated from the dagger by Aes Sedai
      Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory sequence.  These
      gaps were filled and more when he passed through the twisted door to the
      land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three requests:  a foxhead
      medallion that protects him from women's channeling, a way out of the
      land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes that were the
      gaps in his memory.  Mat's <I>ta'veren</I> qualities manifest themselves
      particularly well with random events, such as dice games&mdash;he almost
      never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are weighted.  He has
      found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling, and along with his
      newfound memories he can win almost every battle he fights quite
      decisively.  He has four sisters, including <A Href="#Eldrin">Eldrin</A>
      and <A Href="#Bode">Bodewhin</A>, who are 17 and 16, respectively.  His
      father <A Href="#Abell">Abell</A> is one of the best archers in the Two
      Rivers, possibly in the World.  Mat has gotten in the habit of carrying
      concealed knives under his clothes in case he is attacked&mdash;his
      collection would surprise anyone.  In the Waste, he met a woman named
      Melindhra, a Maiden of the Spear from the Shaido Clan.  However, she was
      not the <A Href="#9Moons">Daughter of the Nine Moons</A>, who Mat is
      destined to marry according to the Aelfinn; besides, she tried to kill
      him on orders from her master among the Darkfriends.  Mat had to kill
      her to save his own skin, but regretted it deeply.  He also has a scar
      along his neck from where the Eelfinn tried to kill him&mdash;which was
      also in accordance with what the Aelfinn told him, that he is &ldquo;to
      die and live again.&rdquo;  He created an army called the Band of the
      Red Hand, after the army of <A Href="#Aemon">King Aemon</A> of old
      Manetheren, and served in a way as Rand's personal general&mdash;this
      worked well, since Mat seems to be a better general than even
      <A Href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</A>, who has earned his reputation as
      one of the best commanders alive.  Mat does not trust any Aes Sedai, and
      because of this refuses to take his foxhead medallion off even to take a
      bath.  Mat went to Ebou Dar to try to keep an eye on
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> and <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> and
      prevent them from getting themselves killed.  While there he was
      cornered by <A Href="#Tylin">Queen Tylin</A>, who gave him little choice
      but to become her lover.  When the Sea Folk and the Seanchan did battle
      in the city, he made his escape, leaving Tylin tied up under the bed so
      it looked &ldquo;official&rdquo;&mdash;Tylin was found torn limb from
      limb, obviously by the <I>gholam</I> which was no doubt sent to kill
      Mat.  In the process of leaving, Mat also took several <I>sul'dam</I>
      and <I>damane</I> (who were subsequently freed from their collars), and
      even kidnapped <A Href="#Tuon">Tuon</A>, the <A Href="#9Moons">Daughter

      looks like it has been broken more than once, and his face is crushed.

      the head of Rand's school of male channelers, now dubbed the Black
      Tower.  He is almost as strong in the One Power as Rand is.  Taim claims
      to have held off the madness that normally accompanies the taint for
      almost 35 years&mdash;he has been using the One Power for a very long
      time, and knows many tricks that Rand had not thought of on his own or
      been taught by <A Href="#Asmodean">Asmodean</A>, such as how to test men
      for the ability.  He seems to resent being second to Rand, and also gave
      orders to kill Rand.  He is almost as tall as Rand, has a hooked nose
      and dark eyes.  He is a physically powerful and graceful man, although
      his skill with a sword is lacking.  He gives special training to about
      20 or 30 men&mdash;they are the only ones who wear the dragon besides

      a duel to the last, and Nynaeve managed to better Moghedien, much to the
      surprise of both of them.  She managed to escape Nynaeve's tied off
      shield, and on their next encounter, this one in <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>,
      she ripped <A Href="#Birgitte">Birgitte</A>'s soul out of the World of

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Moiraine">Moiraine Damodred</A>, p. 311&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Blue Ajah.  Born of a noble House in Cairhien, she is
      <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</A>'s youngest half-sister, and
      <A Href="#Laman">King Laman</A>'s niece.  She is considered short among
      her people, and the Cairhienin are already a short people.  When it was
      discovered that she had the ability to channel inborn, Moiraine went to
      Tar Valon to become an Aes Sedai.  Just before being raised to the
      shawl, she and her friend <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> witnessed
      Gitara Moroso's Foretelling of the Rebirth of the
      <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>.  Moiraine and Siuan
      walked away from each other and did not speak to each other again (at
      least in public), but both held secret communication with each other and
      dedicated their lives to finding and guiding the
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  Moiraine found the young man she
      sought on Winternight in Emond's Field, a young man named
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, along with two more <I>ta'veren</I>,
      <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A> and <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A>
      and two women with the spark of the Power inborn,
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A> and <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve
      al'Meara</A>.  When Moiraine was shortly raised to the shawl, she met
      <A Href="#Lan">al'Lan Mandragoran</A>, the uncrowned King of Malkier,
      who was fighting alone against the Shadow in the Blight; she asked Lan
      to become her Warder, and he accepted.  She is very strong in the Power,
      stronger than almost all living Aes Sedai.  In the Stone of Tear,
      Moiraine confronted and killed the Forsaken
      <A Href="#Belal">Be'lal</A> with balefire, just before he would have
      killed Rand.  Later, after having an inkling of the future events from
      the testing <I>ter'angreal</I> for the Wise Ones, Moiraine managed to
      push the Forsaken <A Href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</A> through the twisted
      doorway <I>ter'angreal</I> into the land of the Eelfinn, trapping both
      her and Lanfear there.  It is unknown whether Moiraine lives on in the
      land of the Finn, or whether she is dead, but her bond with Lan has
      been severed, and other Aes Sedai consider her a legend, not only for
      discovering the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> but for killing or
      trapping two of the Forsaken as well.  Despite her efforts, and for the
      most part, success, <A Href="#Cadsuane">Cadsuane</A> still thinks she
      &ldquo;bungled&rdquo; things with Rand.  <I>See also</I>

      as first-sisters.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Morgase">Morgase Trakand</A>, p. 19&mdash;Former
      Queen of Andor and High Seat of House Trakand.  Mother of
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> and <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>.  She
      married <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</A>, a prince of
      Cairhien, to further solidify her claim to the Throne of Andor and keep
      peace between the two nations; when <A Href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</A>
      disappeared, Morgase made the best claim to succeed her, and married her
      widower to gain the support that would be gained by such action.
      Taringail was Elayne's and Gawyn's father; he died when they were young.
      Morgase has since gone through several lovers, including
      <A Href="#Thom">Thomdril Merrilin</A>, a former court-bard;
      <A Href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</A>, her First Prince of the Sword and
      Captain of the Guards; and most recently <A Href="#Gaebril">Lord
      Gaebril</A>, a man who led the faction that stilled the riots in Caemlyn
      that sprang up on Morgase's trip to Tar Valon to inquire about Elayne's
      whereabouts.  Thom was exiled from the city of Caemlyn when he started
      telling her what he really thought of some of her plans, her
      relationship with Bryne ebbed away until finally Gaebril told her to
      exile him too, and Gaebril eventually chased Morgase herself out of the
      city when she found he was usurping her power.  The Daughter-Heir of
      Andor is traditionally trained by Aes Sedai in the White Tower, and
      Morgase underwent novice training to keep the tradition alive.  She was
      given the gift of a Great Serpent ring despite not being Accepted, and
      still wears it on her left hand.  She was previously advised by
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</A> of the Red Ajah, who is
      now the <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A> in Tar Valon.  When Morgase
      discovered that Gaebril (who, unbeknownst to her, was actually
      <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A>) meant to usurp her throne, she left, and
      when she learned that the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> had taken
      over Caemlyn and none of her former supporters would give her aid, she
      fled to Amadicia to get help from the only place she thought she could:
      <A Href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</A> and the Children of the Light.  She
      was not aware that <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> only wanted to give her
      country back to her, not to mention believes that she is dead.  If she
      had made her presence known, she would no doubt have had her country
      back in one piece, but as royalty she believed she must work on her own
      and trust no one.  She went into hiding after the Seanchan attack
      (Valda believes her to be dead) under her mother's first name,
      <A Href="#Dorlain">Maighdin</A> to avoid instant recognition, and later
      became a maidservant to <A Href="#Faile">Faile</A>; she told Faile that
      she was a lady's handmaid before coming into her service.  When Faile's
      group was captured, she became a prisoner of the Shaido, and is now
      detained in their encampment.  Her sign is three golden keys.  A former
      member of the Queen's Guard, <A Href="#Tallanvor">Martyn Tallanvor</A>,
      has taken a liking to his former queen, and she finds herself almost
      unconsciously returning his attentions.  Her adopted son
      <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A> believes her dead at the hands of Eamon
      Valda, and plans revenge on him.  Her son Gawyn believes her dead at the
      hands of the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>, and is only restrained
      from killing her by <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>'s command.  Her
      daughter Elayne believes her dead as well (though she as yet has no
      plans for vengeance), and her new mistress Faile has no idea of her true
      identity.

      defiance of all law and custom, inside the Tower and out.  She fled the

      of her Ajah.  She was one of the six sisters who held much of the power

      She has already developed several Talents, including the ability to see
      <I>ta'veren</I> and Foretelling, although what she Foretells is usually
      in such language that only poets can understand it.  Her potential

      She has a limited ability to make <I>cuendillar</I>, but she is
      impatient in learning.  She is very arrogant and can also be deceitful;
      she once tried to blackmail <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>,
      <A Href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</A>, and <A Href="#Nisao">Nisao</A>.  She
      used the fact that she could Foretell to be even more arrogant and
      demand even more special treatment.  When Egwene refused to grant her
      that treatment, she ran away to the White Tower, thinking they would let
      her progress at the pace she wanted.  She could not have been more
      incorrect, of course, and her life in the Tower is no doubt even more
      abysmal than it was before.  It will get even worse if a sister ever
      finds out that she lied about her age; she is too old to be entered into
      the novice book by Tower law.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Nynaeve">el'Nynaeve ti al'Meara Mandragoran</A>,
      p. 84&mdash;Young woman from Emond's Field, now an Aes Sedai
      of the Yellow Ajah.  She was the Wisdom of her village, the youngest
      such ever chosen in Emond's Field.  She left when four of her villagers
      were taken away from the Two Rivers by <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>
      and <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>.  While the group traveled away from her home
      and toward her new life, Nynaeve made several discoveries:  she could
      channel the One Power, and had already done so without really knowing
      what she was doing; she developed feelings for Lan Mandragoran,
      Moiraine's Warder and the uncrowned king of the now dead nation Malkier;
      and she has a major role to play, as all of her younger friends in the
      group do, in the years to come.  She is very strong in the One Power;
      only a select few who were alive during the Age of Legends could match
      her as well as a few young women still being trained.  When she arrived
      in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a novice,
      despite not being able to even <I>sense</I> the True Source unless
      angry, a result of her having to learn some minimal control of her
      ability without teaching.  She was sent on a false mission by
      <A Href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</A> on which she was almost leashed by the
      Seanchan as <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> was.  After she returned to the
      Tower, <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> sent her on a mission to hunt
      down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in
      Tanchico, she encountered <A Href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</A> and managed
      to better her in a duel of the Power.  Moghedien escaped, but two
      encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her,
      leashing her with an <I>a'dam</I> in <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>.  Nynaeve
      took Moghedien with her to seek out <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> and
      <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A> while they were fighting each other, and at
      the last moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin
      to ash with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could
      draw to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain
      control of himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire.  Nynaeve then kept
      Moghedien under control with a modified <I>a'dam</I> in Salidar.
      Nynaeve wished to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she
      thinks the Tower meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and
      wants no part of it.  She is determined to Heal anything short of death,
      and has already managed to Heal gentling.  Nynaeve felt bad when
      Moiraine died, because her first thought was not of her, but that now
      Lan was free from their bond.  She was not told that Lan's bond had been
      passed to <A Href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</A> at the moment of Moiraine's
      death.  She and Lan are now married, and the plan is for Lan's bond to
      pass to her as soon as she and Myrelle can get together.  As Lan's wife,
      she will become the Queen of Malkier when and if Lan raises the Golden
      Crane and frees Malkier from the Blight.  She now wears the
      <I>ki'sain</I>, an ornament traditionally worn by Malkieri wives,
      consisting of a dot on the forehead between the eyes&mdash;Lan did not
      tell her of this tradition, but when she found out she immediately took
      it up.  It is the one element of her appearance that never fades for one
      second when every other part changes faster than the eye can follow in
      <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>.  Because she was the only person Rand felt he
      could trust to link with him and the Choedan Kal, he asked Nynaeve to
      assist him when he cleansed <I>saidin</I>.  She now carries the
      <I>ter'angreal</I> she found in Ebou Dar nearly all the time.

      in company with <A Href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</A>,
      <A Href="#Agelmar">Agelmar Jagad</A>, <A Href="#Rodel">Rodel
      Ituralde</A>, <A Href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</A>,
      <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A>, and several Aiel chiefs.  He was trying
      to get Altara and Murandy to cede land to Illian so the Council of Nine
      would not invade both countries.  He also tried to expand Amadicia's
      borders into parts of Ghealdan.  His headquarters were in Amadicia, and
      he ruled there even above <A Href="#Ailron">King Ailron</A>, although
      this was not spoken of openly.  Niall once offered a treaty with
      <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A> of Andor, offering Whitecloak
      assistance to retake her throne in exchange for Whitecloak presence in
      Caemlyn and elsewhere in Andor, a presence that Morgase had not allowed
      even a fraction of during her reign.  Niall was killed by his alleged
      Spymaster, <A Href="#Omerna">Abdel Omerna</A>, who claimed he had gone
      against everything the Children stood for by allowing Morgase to avoid
      being put to the question.  He was replaced by
      <A Href="#Valda">Eamon Valda</A>, who also killed Omerna.  Rumor puts
      him dead in a duel or a skirmish.  <I>See also</I>

      right side of her face and tightly curled gray hair.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Pelivar">Pelivar Coelan</A>, p. 371&mdash;Andoran
      noble, leader of a strong House that supported
      <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A> during the Succession.  Morgase exiled
      him from Caemlyn as per <A Href="#Gaebril">Gaebril</A>'s suggestion, but
      she hoped he would still support her when she came to reclaim the
      throne.  He is one of the lords in Andor who arrested
      <A Href="#Naean">Naean</A> and <A Href="#Elenia">Elenia</A> for claiming
      the Lion Throne; he later led the Andoran troops that confronted the Aes
      Sedai led by <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>.  He is hesistant to support
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>'s claim to the Lion Throne, and instead
      wants <A Href="#Dyelin">Dyelin</A> to assume the Throne.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Perival">Perival Mantear</A>, p. 372&mdash;High
      Seat of House Mantear.  He is a pretty, golden-haired boy.  He pledged
      the support of House Mantear to <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> on his
      first trip to Caemlyn.  His House controlled the Lion Throne until the
      death of <A Href="#Mordrellen">Queen Mordrellen</A>, both because the
      Daughter-Heir disappeared and because the family had become heavy with
      male children.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Perrin">Perrin t'Bashere Aybara</A>, p.
      168&mdash;A young man from Emond's Field.  He is <I>ta'veren</I>.  When
      he and <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> got separated from the rest of the
      group while fleeing the Trollocs on Winternight, Perrin met a man named
      <A Href="#Elyas">Elyas Machera</A>.  Elyas, a former Warder who found he
      could talk to wolves, helped Perrin discover the same ability in
      himself.  Perrin's eyes are now yellow, just like the wolves' eyes, and
      he can enter what he calls the Wolf Dream (known to most as
      <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>, the World of Dreams) with them.  Perrin is a
      childhood friend of fellow <I>ta'veren</I>
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> and <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A>.  On
      the way to Tear, Perrin encountered a young woman by the name of
      <A Href="#Zarine">Zarine Bashere</A>, a Hunter for the Horn who
      took the name of <A Href="#Faile">Faile</A> (which means
      &ldquo;Falcon&rdquo; in the Old Tongue) as a more appropriate name for a
      Hunter for the Horn.  The two are now married.  Perrin is a very large
      man&mdash;he was always a big person, which caused him to be very
      cautious since he found as a child that he could easily hurt other
      children if his temper got out of hand.  His size helps considerably
      when helping <A Href="#Haral">Master Luhhan</A> on his forge, but
      sometimes gives others the impression that he is slow and stupid.  He
      returned to the Two Rivers for a time to repel the series of Trolloc
      attacks; he and his wife are recognized as Lord and Lady there, the
      first noblility of the Two Rivers since the Trolloc Wars.  When he
      returned, he began to draw the eye of <A Href="#Berelain">Berelain sur
      Paendrag Paeron</A>, the First of Mayene&mdash;Perrin wants nothing more
      than to be as far from her as possible, but Berelain will not take no
      for an answer, much to Faile's dismay and intense jealousy.  Perrin was
      instrumental in freeing Rand from his entrapment at Dumai's Wells; the
      two had a fight afterwards (they had planned it as a way for Perrin to
      leave, although they most likely did not plan on it being as violent as
      it was), and Perrin went to Ghealdan to see if he could tame
      <A Href="#Masema">Masema</A>.  On the way, his wife was captured by
      Shaido, and now he must track her down.  He has a rope that he ties a
      knot in for every day she is held captive; he has plans in the making
      that should allow him to throw that cord away soon.  <I>See also</I>

      Sedai of the Red Ajah.  She is short for a Kandori, and quite plump, but
      tough.  She goes against all Red Ajah custom to openly say that Warders
      would make a Red sister's job easier.  She and her friend since
      novicehood, <A Href="#Seaine">Seaine</A>, began a hunt for Darkfriends
      in the Tower.  Seaine approached her not only because they were friends,
      but because Seaine's family was killed by Darkfriends when she was
      young.  She joined the Red Ajah because its task was one which involved
      being outside the Tower often, and she considered it more likely to be
      able to find and bring to justice the Darkfriends that killed her family
      and others like them.  She now leads the organization of sisters in the
      White Tower to ferret out Black sisters, along with
      <A Href="#Saerin">Saerin Sedai</A>, who seized control away from

      barely manage one big enough to walk through.  She instructed

      suspicious that Pritalle may also be Black.  She was among those who
      captured <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>.  Pritalle did her best to avoid

      considered almost god-like among her subjects.  Contrary to the almost
      automatic utterings of her subjects, Radhanan will not only not live

      along with <A Href="#Merana">Merana</A>.  <A Href="#Min">Min</A> says

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Rahvin">Rahvin</A>, p. 142&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  He was fond of using Compulsion, and was known for being a

      released from the Bore, he took up residence in Caemlyn as
      <A Href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</A>, and used Compulsion to have
      <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A> not only make him her advisor, but
      her lover as well.  He eventually planned to take over the country
      directly as the first ever King of Andor&mdash;he did his best to weaken
      support for Morgase, exiling her supporters and befriending those who
      opposed her, finally chasing her from the country as well.  Shortly
      after news of Morgase's death or at least abdication reached Cairhien,
      Rahvin was confronted and killed by <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> in
      <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I> with a weave of balefire strong enough to burn

      Emond's Field in the Two Rivers, now proclaimed to be the
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  He is very tall, with curly
      red-blond hair.  He was raised by <A Href="#Tam">Tam al'Thor</A> and his
      wife <A Href="#Kari">Kari</A> (until her death around the time Rand was
      five) in Emond's Field.  His real parents, however, were
      <A Href="#Janduin">Janduin</A>, the chief of the Taardad Aiel who
      brought the four clans across the Dragonwall to punish
      <A Href="#Laman">Laman</A>'s Sin, and a Maiden of the Spear named
      <A Href="#Shaiel">Shaiel</A>, who was actually
      <A Href="#Tigraine">Tigraine Damodred</A>, the runaway Daughter-Heir of
      Andor.  Tigraine gave birth to Rand on the slopes of Dragonmount, in
      accordance with prophecy; &ldquo;born of a Maiden, of the ancient blood
      but raised by the Old.&rdquo;  Rand has a heron branded into each of his
      palms, which he received from the sword Tam gave him while fighting
      <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A>.  He also has two
      dragons on his forearms, which he received in Rhuidean to designate him
      as the <I><A Href="#Caracarn">Car'a'carn</A></I>, the Chief of Chiefs of
      the Aiel.  He is not only the Dragon Reborn, but also <A Href="#Dawn">He
      Who Comes With the Dawn</A>, the man prophecied to reunite the Aiel, and
      the <A Href="#Coramoor">Coramoor</A>, the one prophecied to bring the
      Sea Folk out of the Sea.  He can channel strongly, more so than any
      person who ever lived (except the previous user of his soul,
      <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A>, who was obviously of equal
      strength), and is also <I>ta'veren</I>, the most strongly so since Lews
      Therin as well.  Lews Therin's voice has somehow found a new place
      inside of Rand's head; he talks to him in a mad voice when Rand least
      expects it, sometimes offering sound advice or knowledge, sometimes
      babbling, sometimes even trying to wrest control of <I>saidin</I> from
      him.   Unlike Lews Therin, Rand is accompanied by two other
      <I>ta'veren</I> during his turing of the Wheel, two men born within days
      (hours, even) of him named <A Href="#Mat">Matrim Cauthon</A> and
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A>, who both grew up in Emond's Field
      as well.  Rand is destined to fall in love with three women (and has):
      <A Href="#Min">Min Farshaw</A>, <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</A>,
      and <A Href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</A>.  Rand has had success in fighting
      many of the Forsaken; all to confront him have died or been trapped.  He
      killed <A Href="#Aginor">Aginor</A> at the Eye of the World after the
      <A Href="../book1/alphalast.html#Green">Green Man</A> killed
      <A Href="#Balthamel">Balthamel</A>; he allowed
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> to kill
      <A Href="#Belal">Be'lal</A> in the Stone of Tear, and killed
      <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A> in the Stone shortly afterward; in the
      wagons near the Spine of the World, <A Href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</A>
      confronted him and was pushed into the land of the Eelfinn by Moiraine;
      he killed <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A> in <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I> when he
      came to the Royal Palace in Caemlyn;
      <A Href="#Asmodean">Asmodean</A>, his teacher, was killed shortly after
      Rahvin met his fate; <A Href="#Sammael">Sammael</A> met his fate while
      fighting Rand in Shadar Logoth at the hands of Mashadar; and
      <A Href="#Osan">Osan'gar</A>, the reincarnation of
      <A Href="#Aginor">Aginor</A>, died at Shador Logoth when Rand was
      cleansing <I>saidin</I>.  During his duel with Sammael, Rand encountered
      a mysterious wanderer, presumably <A Href="#Moridin">Moridin</A>, who
      helped him.  During the fighting, their streams of balefire collided,
      causing Rand's head to spin and both of them to lose coherency for a
      while.  Ever since that time, Rand has had trouble seizing
      <I>saidin</I>; it is not known if this is because of Moridin's presumed
      use of the True Power, or something else.
      Rand's prophecies fulfilled grow:  he has already
      been born on the slopes of Dragonmount of a Maiden, of the ancient blood
      but raised by the old, taken the Stone of Tear and drawn
      <I>Callandor</I>, and began conquering &ldquo;under the forgotten
      symbol,&rdquo; that of the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  He is
      working on having the &ldquo;spotless tower&rdquo; (i.e. the White
      Tower) break and bend knee to him (the Tower has broken, and several Aes
      Sedai have sworn fealty to him and only him).  He recently used the
      Choedan Kal, the two great <I>sa'angreal</I> created during the War of
      the Shadow, to cleanse the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>'s taint from
      <I>saidin</I>.  He has created schools of sorts, more research
      universities, where some of the best inventors of the day have
      congregated near Cairhien, Caemlyn, and Tear to develop new technology.
      Rand has also created the Asha'man, men who came for his
      &ldquo;amnesty&rdquo; for male channelers.  With <I>saidin</I> cleansed,
      the Asha'man are now safe from the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>'s taint.
      The Asha'man themselves are not free from the Dark One's
      <Em>influence</Em>, however; there are many Darkfriends among the
      Asha'man, including <A Href="#Taim">Mazrim Taim</A>, the leader of the
      Black Tower.  The Asha'man under Taim have turned on Rand, trying to
      kill him and worse, though Rand does not at this point know that they
      were acting with Taim's knowledge.  Rand is the salvation of the entire
      world, and as the prophecy states, he <I>will</I> save the
      world&mdash;and Break it again.  <I>See also</I>

      for the Brown Ajah in Tar Valon from Altara.  She carries a curved
      knife, in the fashion of her native Altara.  She has touches of white
      at her dark temples which emphasize a thin, age-faded white scar.  Only
      a Warder could match her for scowling.  She has held her chair in the
      Hall for forty years, and has worn the shawl for over 150 years.
      Everyone knows to be wary of her temper.  She was born the daughter of
      an innkeeper, and was first trained by the Daughters of Silence (an
      organization similar to, but shorter-lived and smaller than, the
      Kin)&mdash;she was the only one of them to ever obtain the shawl.

      Sea Folk.  She was raised to a Sitter after the sisters banded together
      in Salidar.  She suggested a tax on the towns the Aes Sedai passed
      through to raise money for the ever-growing army.  She has been an Aes
      Sedai only 35 years, which is too young to be a sitter&mdash;most sitters
      have worn the shawl over 100 years by the time they become sitters.  She
      thinks it is wrong to sell objects made from <I>cuendillar</I> that they
      have just made recently.  She also thinks the Yellows are being unfairly
      drawn from Healing to make the objects (as if her Ajah's duty was more

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Semirhage">Semirhage</A>, p. 46&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  During the Age of Legends, she was one of the
      best Healers ever known.  She was called to all corners of the world
      Heal people that others thought beyond help.  However, she was sadistic;
      she exacted a price in the form of pain from her subjects in return for
      her Healing services.  Most thought the pain or anguish she exacted from
      them was a small price to pay for being alive, but eventually the Hall
      of Servants found out about her practices and gave her the choice of
      being either severed or bound with the Power, never again to know her
      &ldquo;pleasures.&rdquo;  She chose instead to pledge for the
      <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>, and created one of the most oppressive and
      pain-filled areas of Shadow control during the entire War of Power.
      After being freed from the Bore, Semirhage went in service to the Dark
      One by extracting information from captured Borderlanders and Aes Sedai.
      She also sent the Trollocs to the Stone of Tear to battle those that
      <A Href="#Sammael">Sammael</A> sent.  She is as tall as most men, and
      wears black most of the time&mdash;perhaps because
      <A Href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</A> always wore white.  It is often joked (or
      used to be, when the Forsaken were still bound) that when it rained

      that she keeps in a tight bun at the back of her head.  She ran a very
      large family with a very firm hand until her children (and their
      children) grew up.  She seems to have adopted all of the novices as
      granddaughters, or at least as great nieces.  She was the woman who
      organized all the novices into &ldquo;families&rdquo;&mdash;she was
      apparently disgusted watching everyone simply floundering around.
      <I>Editor's note:  there is a distinct possibility that this Sharina is
      the same one as the Aes Sedai advisor to Nynaeve and
      <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A> from Nynaeve's test for being raised to Accepted.
      These tests are based on possible future events, and the chance that

      She began as a strong Amyrlin, firmly in charge of the Hall and the

      she was told.  The Hall mishandled events itself, too, leading to one of
      only six mutinies in Tower history, which pulled down both Shein and
      the Hall.  She allegedly died of natural causes, but in fact she was
      smothered in her bed in exile fifty-one years later after a plot was
      discovered to put her back on the Amyrlin Seat.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>, p. 77&mdash;Aes Sedai of

      she was sent to the White
      Tower on the first boat to leave after she discovered she had the
      ability to channel inborn, according to Tairen law.  As a novice, she
      was good friends with <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine Damodred</A>, and was
      present at <A Href="#Gitara">Gitara Moroso</A>'s Foretelling of the
      Rebirth of the <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>.  After being raised to the
      shawl, she joined the Blue Ajah to dedicate her life to finding and
      guiding the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>, and eventually came to
      lead the Blues' network of eyes-and-ears (i.e. spies) before being
      raised to the <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>.  She was only thirty
      years old when raised to the Amyrlin Seat, making her the youngest
      Amyrlin to that point.  She was also one of the strongest Amyrlins in
      recent history, and one of the most feared among the rulers of nations.
      Her blue-eyed stare was feared by all.  When her twenty-year connection
      to the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> was discovered, she and her
      <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A>, <A Href="#Leane">Leane
      Sharif</A>, were deposed and stilled by a group of sisters loyal to
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida a'Roihan</A>.  Siuan hoped to regain some of
      her previous standing in the new Tower that separated from
      Elaida&mdash;her knowledge of the Blue Ajah spy network is hard to
      match, and she knows much that she thought would be of use.  In one of
      her viewings, <A Href="#Min">Min</A> saw that Siuan would have to remain
      close by to <A Href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</A>&mdash;if she did not, both
      of them would die.  Siuan did not initially know what she meant, but now
      realizes that she is growing to love the gray-haired man who leads the
      Salidar army.  She had a Warder named <A Href="#Alric">Alric</A>, but he
      died when she was deposed.  After coming to Salidar,
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> discovered how to restore Siuan's ability
      to channel, at least partially.  This resurrected a part of her bond
      with Alric, but did not bring back her former strength, or her binding
      by the Oath Rod.  She can now lie as well as any child.  She now serves
      as an &ldquo;advisor&rdquo; to the new Amyrlin in Salidar,
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A>, but though she puts on a
      fa&ccedil;ade of hating the work, she is actually one of Egwene's
      foremost agents.  The fact that she is Aes Sedai, not to mention one who
      was stilled and Healed again, makes other sisters tend to be oblivious
      to this fact.  She was pushed very hard by Elaida as a novice.

      knew she would choose.  It certainly fits with the idea of most Aes

      Her kingdom was small, and she only ruled a portion of it; the rest was
      governed by nobles who were not necessarily loyal to her.  She was the
      second from her House to sit on the throne&mdash;this was the maximum
      traditionally, and the only House to hold it for four generations fell
      so fast from power that it could not recover.  She was advised by
      <A Href="#Merilille">Merilille Ceandevin</A> of the Gray Ajah.  She was
      a widow, and does not plan to marry again.  She took an interest in
      <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A>, and contrary to Mat's usual tactic of
      chasing women, <I>she</I> chased and caught <I>him</I>.  The
      two were lovers for some time.  When the Seanchan invaded her nation,
      she cooperated with them out of necessity&mdash;they let her keep her
      position of authority, but she was a puppet of the Crystal Throne.
      When the Sea Folk fought the Seanchan, destroying much of Ebou Dar in
      the process, Tylin suggested Mat use the opportunity to escape the city,
      and tie her up under the bed to make it look like he had to restrain
      her to escape.  While she was bound and gagged under the bed, the
      <I>gholam</I> came, presumably to kill Mat, and she fell easy prey to
      it.  She was found by <A Href="#Suroth">Suroth</A>'s people the next
