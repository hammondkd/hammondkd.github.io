  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Yulan">Abaldar Yulan</A>, p.
      304&mdash;Former Captain of the Air and pilot of a Seanchan <I>raken</I>
      for the Forerunners.  He is small and dark.  He has since been promoted
      to Lieutenant General, and is a member of the Low Blood.
  <Li><A Class="name">Abram</A>, p. 437&mdash;Person to whom a feast is
      dedicated in the village of Hinderstap (and presumably other villages in
      the same region).
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Adamad">Adamad</A>, p. 24&mdash;One of
    <A Href="#Fanwar">Fanwar</A>'s farm hands.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Adelorna">Adelorna Bastine</A>,
      p. 629&mdash;Short, slim, Saldaean Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah.
      She is the Captain-General of the Green Ajah, the Ajah's leader.
      She was once birched by <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>.
      She chose <A Href="#Rina">Rina</A> for the Hall without a nominations
      process, which goes against Green custom.  She has three Warders.
      She is slim, and of a height with <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>.
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Talric">Talric</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Adrin">Adrin</A>, p. 180&mdash;Ill-fated guard at
      the doorway to the manor <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> seizes in Arad Doman.
      He was killed by a bubble of evil that nearly took the rest of the
      manor with it.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Adsalan">Adsalan</A>, p. 203&mdash;Warder on guard
      at the door to the Black Ajah hunters' headquarters.  He is brutish.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aemin">Aemin</A>, p.
      330&mdash;Graying, blocky farrier.  He travels with
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Lan">al'Lan Mandragoran</A>, p. 123&mdash;The
      uncrowned king of Malkier, and formerly Warder to
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>.  He is quite tall, and does not get
      very emotional&mdash;in fact, he has emotional walls all around him that
      he has been building for years.  His country, Malkier, was overrun by
      Trollocs shortly after he was born, and is now corrupted by the Great
      Blight.  Lan, among the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a
      one-man war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight.  He
      fought Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status.  He
      was eventually bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at
      least changed its style).  When Lan and Moiraine brought
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>, <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>,
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A>, <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>, and
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> out of their home in the Two Rivers, he
      found that there was something which could throw his guard down, but he
      was the last to notice it:  affection for Nynaeve.  As Moiraine put it,
      Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan's emotional walls and break them
      down without him even knowing they were there.  The two of them are now
      married.  According to the terms of their vows as taken before the Sea
      Folk, one of them must obey in public while the other obeys in private;
      for obvious reasons, Nynaeve is the one who commands in public.
      Upon Moiraine's death, Lan's bond was immediately transferred
      to <A Href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</A> until Nynaeve is ready to have his
      bond transferred to her.  Myrelle tried to keep Lan's status secret, but
      she was given away when she tried to buy one of Lan's favorite foods,
      coin peppers, too far south (they are very popular in Shienar, and were
      in Malkier before it fell to the Blight, but do not grow well in
      southern climates).  Upon learning of where Lan was,
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> sent him to Ebou Dar to serve as a Warder
      for Nynaeve.  He traveled with his wife and the group of Aes Sedai
      she accompanies until he started to feel longing for his homeland.
      Nynaeve understood that he needed to finish his fight in the Blight,
      but she vowed to increase his chance of survival by dropping him off at
      World's End in Saldaea and alerting every surviving Malkieri she could
      find that Lan was marching for Tarwin's Gap. According to the Wise Ones,
      <I><A Href="#Aan">Aan'allein</A></I> (as the Aiel call him) will die the
      day he learns that Nynaeve is dead.  He is one of the best, if not
      <I>the</I> best, warriors, swordsmen, and Warders in the world.

      <A Href="#Moiraine">Damodred, Moiraine</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alamindra">Alamindra Cutren</A>, p.
      483&mdash;Member of the Domani merchants council.  She hid on her cousin
      lands in northern Arad Doman.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alanna">Alanna Mosvani</A>, p. 663&mdash;Aes Sedai
      of the Green Ajah.  She is dark and slender with black hair and dark
      eyes.  She has two surviving Warders, <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> (whom she
      bonded against his will) and <A Href="#Ihvon">Ihvon</A>; her other,
      <A Href="#Owein">Owein</A>, died in the Two Rivers while scouting the
      Whitecloak camp.  She later found that bonding Rand was a grievious
      error; not only is it impossible to Compel him in comparison to most
      Warders (she compared it to attempting to uproot an oak tree with her
      bare hands), but she constantly feels the pain he experiences from the
      wound in his side, perhaps even more severely than he feels it.  She is
      now in Tear, but the other Aes Sedai there are avoiding her notice.
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Rand">al'Thor, Rand</A>;
      <A Href="#Ihvon">Ihvon</A>; <A Href="#Owein">Owein</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aldan">Aldan</A>, p. 366&mdash;Captain in
      <A Href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</A>'s army.  He is in charge of new
      recruits.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Algarin">Algarin Pendaloan</A>, p.
      53&mdash;Lesser Lord of the Land in Tear.  He has a wrinkly face and a
      white beard.  He provided accomodations for <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>,
      <A Href="#Min">Min</A>, <A Href="#Verin">Verin</A>,
      <A Href="#Cadsuane">Cadsuane</A>, <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>,
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>, and the rest of their group on his manor
      so they could recuperate from the events at Shadar Logoth.  His younger
      brother <A Href="#Emarin">Emarin</A> could channel, and Algarin wants to
      be tested for the ability now as well.  While he was away at the Black
      Tower, Rand used his estates in Tear to lay low for a while.
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Emarin">Pendaloan, Emarin</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alivia">Alivia</A>, p. 60&mdash;Seanchan
      <I>damane</I> captured by Asha'man.  She was afraid of freedom because
      she feared being captured again.  She has been collared since she was
      thirteen or fourteen, and has been <I>damane</I> for over four hundred
      years.  She is considerably stronger in the One Power than
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>, and a little bit taller.  She has fine
      lines at the corners of her sharp blue eyes and white streaks in her
      blonde hair.  <A Href="#Min">Min</A> dislikes her, though not because of
      jealousy&mdash;Min had a viewing of her indicating that she will help
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> to die.  She has a very intense personality.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alliandre">Alliandre Maritha Kigarin</A>, p.
      155&mdash;Blessed of the Light, Queen of Ghealdan, Defender of Garen's
      Wall.  She is the fourth person to sit on the throne of Ghealdan in the
      past several months.  She wore jewelry to her meetings with
      <A Href="#Masema">Masema</A> for the sole purpose of giving it to him
      such that he would not ask for anything more; she also sent a letter
      to <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> offering him her friendship and asking for
      his help.  She was subsequently captured by the Shaido Aiel, and is now
      one of <A Href="#Faile">Faile</A>'s followers.
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Masema">Dagar, Masema</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alric">Alric</A>,
      p. 627&mdash;<A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A>'s Warder for about twenty years.
      He was murdered when Siuan was deposed; the shock of what
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A> intended to do masked the usual emotions
      that accompany the death of a Warder for her at first, and when she was
      stilled she lost all contact with the destroyed bond.  However, when she
      was Healed, all the emotions came rushing back to her.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Siuan">Sanche, Siuan</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alsalam">Alsalam</A>, p. 132&mdash;King of Arad
      Doman.  He had been a good ruler for over twenty years, though the
      Council had recently smuggled him out of Bandar Eban&mdash;after leaving
      the city, he seemed to have taken on the notion that he was the Rebirth
      of <A Href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</A>.
      He is believed to either be dead or one of
      <A Href="#Graendal">Graendal</A>'s playthings.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aludra">Aludra</A>, p. 400&mdash;Illuminator from
      Tarabon with dark waist-length hair done in thin braids, large dark
      eyes, and a plump mouth.  She was involved with the fireworks display
      for <A Href="#Galldrian">King Galldrian</A> of Cairhien that went awry
      when Trollocs came.  She was blamed for its failure, though she
      believed one of her colleagues,
      <A Href="../book3/chron.html#Tammuz">Tammuz</A>,
      was to blame.  She was cast out
      of the Illuminators' Guild, and when she refused to stop practicing the
      art of making fireworks, several men tried to kill her.  She was saved
      by <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A> and <A Href="#Thom">Thom</A> in a barn, and as
      a sign of gratitude she gave Mat a roll of fireworks.  She later came to
      Ebou Dar, and asked Mat to find her a bellfounder.  He was knocked out
      during the battle and thus missed the bellfounder, but Aludra escaped
      and she now travles with Mat's entourage.  Since the Seanchan destroyed
      the Chapter House of the Illuminators in Tanchico, Aludra may be the
      last Illuminator alive.  She is planning to make dragons, what most of
      us would call cannons.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</A>, p. 68&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the White Ajah, but secretly the head of the Black Ajah.  She
      was chosen to head the Black Ajah after the previous leader was killed
      by <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A> after she managed to kill off the
      <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A> without Ishamael's approval.
      Typical of most Whites, she has a very cool, collected personality.
      She served as <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A> under
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>, despite being of a different Ajah than
      Elaida was raised from.  Elaida was all but forced to choose Alviarin in
      order to gain the support of the White Ajah when bringing charges
      against <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A>; unknown to Elaida, this also brought
      her the support of the Black Ajah.  Without Alviarin as Keeper, the
      White Ajah would most likely have been divided over whether to depose
      Siuan, and only the Red would be behind Elaida, which would most likely
      have led to the stilling of Elaida and possibly even the dismantling of
      the Red Ajah.  It still may, since Elaida is rapidly losing her support
      among the sisters.  If Alviarin's loyalties are ever revealed, it is
      likely nothing will save either of them.
      Alviarin has been shown how to Travel by
      <A Href="#Mesaana">Mesaana</A>, and one of her first uses of it brought
      her to Tremalking for several weeks, during which Elaida removed her as
      Keeper.  She appears to know that the Aes Sedai sent back from Salidar
      are spies; she refused to let Elaida speak with
      <A Href="#Meidani">Meidani</A>, who was one of them.  She has since been
      estranged from the White Ajah; her fellow Whites blame her for
      destroying their connection to the Amyrlin, and humiliating herself and
      her Ajah in the process.  She has since been sent to
      <A Href="#Silviana">Silviana</A> for daily beatings.
      Despite her failures, <A Href="#Shaidar">Shaidar Haran</A> has
      promised her that she is still his praised servant;
      he marked her for his own with an invisible mark on her forehead that
      only Alviarin can sense.

      <A Href="#Elaida">a'Roihan, Elaida</A>;
      <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Amathera">Amathera Aelfdene Casmir Lounault</A>,
      p. 400&mdash;Former Panarch of Tarabon.  She vanished, allegedly at
      Aes Sedai hands, according to White Tower spies.  In reality, Amathera
      was being held prisoner by sisters of the Black Ajah under
      <A Href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</A>, and was rescued by
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> and <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>.  They
      had her keep a low profile for several days so as not to be hurt by the
      mob outside the Panarch's Palace (since it is not all that far from
      &ldquo;The Panarch is dead!&rdquo; to &ldquo;Death to the
      Panarch!&rdquo;), then she returned to her position.  When the Seanchan
      invaded Tanchico, she refused to willingly give her country to the new
      conquerors; they captured her, and forced her to live as a servant.  She
      served as a dancer for <A Href="#Suroth">High Lady Suroth</A>, the
      leader of the Seanchan pre-invasionary forces, until she was rescued by
      <A Href="#Juilin">Juilin Sandar</A>, who took her along when he fled
      Ebou Dar with <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>.  She and Juilin have become an
      item since that time; he has been training her, with limited success, to
      stop flinching every time a Seanchan officer walks by.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Juilin">Sandar, Juilin</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Amenar">Amenar Shumada</A>, p. 296&mdash;Member of
      the Seanchan Blood with a long face.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>, p. 62&mdash;The leader
      of the Aes Sedai, their equivalent of a King or Queen.  She in theory
      holds supreme power amongst the sisters, and leads the Hall of the Tower
      at its meetings.  Kings and queens of nations strong and weak will come
      if summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their entire trip
      figuring out how they will put a knife in her back while there.  The
      Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in
      her character.  The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must
      the vote to depose one.  Once chosen, the Amyrlin is said to be
      &ldquo;of all Ajahs and none&ldquo;&mdash;all previous affiliations with
      Ajah are ignored (at least in theory).  The Ajahs have gotten fairly
      equal numbers of Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions.
      No Amyrlin had been raised from the Red Ajah since
      <A Href="../book5/alphalast.html#Bonwhin">Bonwhin Meraighdin</A>, who
      was deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in
      <A Href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</A>'s day, except for
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</A>, the current Amyrlin
      Seat in Tar Valon; the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of
      Amyrlins from its Ajah&mdash;four of the last the last five Amyrlins
      (before Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah.  These two exceptions to
      the mean number of Amyrlins from one's Ajah have only added to the
      friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years.  The Amyrlin has
      a secretary of sorts, the <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the
      Chronicles</A>, who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the
      Amyrlin was raised from.  The Amyrlin Seat was held by
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>, raised from the Blue Ajah, until she
      was deposed for her involvement with events surrounding the
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  Her successor was the leader of
      the coup, <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</A>, raised from
      the Red Ajah.  Siuan's deposition divided the Tower, and the faction
      opposing Elaida raised a new Amyrlin who could not be accused of
      choosing sides on the fateful day Siuan was deposed:
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A>, who was outside the Tower and not
      even a full sister from the time Siuan was deposed to the time Egwene
      was Raised.  Other sisters outside the Tower have, in many cases,
      yet to reveal their loyalties to either Egwene or Elaida.

      of the Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel.
      <A Href="#Rhuarc">Rhuarc</A>'s wife (one of two).  She is one of the
      Wise Ones that trained <A Href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</A> and
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>.  She can channel, but still has prematurely

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Anaiya">Anaiya</A>, p. 150&mdash;Aes Sedai of the
      Blue Ajah.  She had blunt, motherly facial features.  She was very good
      friends with <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> both as a novice and as a
      full sister.  She, like all Blues, fled the Tower when
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A> was raised to the Striped Stole, and
      carried a position of considerable influence in the &ldquo;Little
      Tower&rdquo; in exile from Tar Valon.  She dressed very simply, and very
      little upset her.  She was Aes Sedai for 50 or 60 years before
      <A Href="#Kairen">Kairen</A> came to the Tower.  She was killed, along
      with her Warder, presumably by <A Href="#Arangar"><I>Aran'gar</I></A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Anaiyella">Anaiyella Narencelona</A>, p.
      662&mdash;Willowy, simpering High Lady of Tear.  She seems a fool, and
      is all mincing elegance and simpers.  She is slim and pretty.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Anath">Anath Dorje</A>, p.
      28&mdash;<A Href="#Selucia">Selucia</A>'s former <I>Soe'feia</I>, or
      Truthspeaker.  She now serves <A Href="#Tuon">Tuon</A>, allegedly.
      She is very tall and slender with dark skin and black eyes.
      She seems to get a charge out of inflicting pain.
      Anath is, of course, <A Href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</A>, who had
      somehow managed to gain a significant amount of trust with the Seanchan
      in a very short period of time (as have the other Forsaken in their
      countries of choice).
      She conned several <I>sul'dam</I>/<I>damane</I> pairs into helping her
      attempt to capture <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>; in the process, she herself
      was captured and exposed.
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Andaya">Andaya Forae</A>, p. 711&mdash;Sitter for
      the Gray Ajah in Tar Valon.  She has light brown hair, and grew up in

      <A Href="#Serancha">Serancha</A>, the head of the Gray Ajah, practically
      annointed her to her seat in the Hall.  Everyone expected Andaya to be

      years to pass before it occured.
      She was chosen to meet <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> at the bridges into

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Arangar">Aran'gar</A>, p. 36&mdash;Name given to
      the reincarnation of <A Href="#Balthamel">Balthamel</A>.  Aran'gar was
      the right-hand dagger in a form of dueling popular right after the
      creation of the Bore.  The sport fell from common practice, since almost
      invariably both duelists died from the slow poison on the daggers.  The
      other Forsaken consider Balthamel's new body a fine joke; the soul of
      Balthamel now occupies the body of a beautiful young woman.  She still
      channels <I>saidin</I>, and now serves as <A Href="#Delana">Delana</A>'s
      maid.  Delana does not know that she is one of the Chosen reincarned,
      just that she stands far above her among the Darkfriends.  Aran'gar, as
      Balthamel, specialized in primitive cultures.
      Aran'gar's cover was blown when she tried to touch the ward against
      eavesdropping around the meeting of the Hall of the Tower in exile,
      at which time <A Href="#Romanda">Romanda Cassin</A> deduced that she and

      Sevanna for her own punishment.  Before leaving her with Sevanna,
      however, she swore fealty to Faile, using Faile's new last name.  She
      knew Faile planned to escape, and wanted to help&mdash;provided she
      could escape as well.  She was once a noble, it appears.  She grew up
      in Amadicia.  Her face is plump, but still haggard from her captivity.

      She got protection from some people in the camp

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</A>, p. 51&mdash;Hero of

      <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A> and <A Href="#Rand">Rand

      new lands there.  All contact with these armies ended with Hawkwing's
      death, which set off the War of the Hundred Years.  The descendants of
      the armies under Luthair have now returned to reclaim the lands of
      Hawkwing's empire in the Old World&mdash;they now call themselves the
      Seanchan.  Artur Hawkwing's real name was <A Href="#Artur">Artur

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Asmodean">Asmodean</A>, p. 55&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  He was born Joar Addam Nessosin, a child prodigy in music
      and art, in the then coastal city of Shorelle.  He gave his life to the
      Shadow in exchange for the immortality he received, so he could study
      and perfect his music.  After being released from the Bore, he was
      coerced by <A Href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</A> into coming with her,
      eventually to teach <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> to channel without killing
      himself.  Asmodean was drawn to Rhuidean and the stash of
      <I>angreal</I>, <I>ter'angreal</I>, and most especially the two white
      statue <I>ter'angreal</I> that linked the holder to the great
      <I>sa'angreal</I> buried near Cairhien and on Tremalking, which together
      could Break the World beyond repair.  He went there to obtain the male
      statue, but was thwarted by Rand, who severed his bonds to the
      <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>.  He then became Rand's teacher, and went
      into hiding from the rest of the Chosen, who would kill him on sight if
      they saw him.  He was killed by someone of unknown identity right after
      <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A> and Lanfear were killed/trapped.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Auaine">Auaine Fanwar</A>, p. 19&mdash;Wife of

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aviendha">Aviendha</A>, p. 54&mdash;Aiel of the
      Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel.  Formerly a Maiden of the Spear,
      she was forced to give up the spear to become a Wise One because she had
      the ability to channel inborn.  She has green eyes, and is of age with
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> and <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>.  She is more than
      pretty with her dark reddish hair.  Aviendha is one of the three women
      in <A Href="#Min">Min</A>'s viewing of Rand&mdash;she also saw that
      she was to fall in love with him when she went through the three rings
      in Rhuidean.  She denied her feelings for him at first, but when the
      wagons crossed the Dragonwall toward Cairhien, sweat tents became
      unavailable and she tried bathing as &ldquo;wetlanders&rdquo; did; Rand
      came in as she was standing before the bath in her skin, and she
      panicked.  She created a Traveling gateway to northern Seanchan (she
      does not remember how), trying to get as far away from Rand as possible,
      into the middle of winter.  When Rand rescued her, she decided she could
      not hide her feelings any longer, and the two ended up spending the
      night in each other's arms before coming back.  Aviendha says a similar
      incident will not occur, and punished any Maiden who made a crack about
      it (how they found out about something that occurred on the far side of
      the world on another continent is a different subject entirely).  She
      felt <I>toh</I> toward <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> for violating her
      trust, but upon hearing that Elayne would consent to being her
      sister-wife, Aviendha felt empowered to show her feelings for Rand once
      again.  She is not certain what she thinks of a <I>second</I>
      sister-wife in Min, but she seems to accept the idea at least.  She has
      been having trouble learning Traveling again; the way Elayne forms the
      weave is different from how she used it to get to Seanchan, and it is
      difficult to learn something once you already learned it another way.
      She has, however, mastered the art of untying weaves&mdash;a feat which
      was thought impossible by all Aes Sedai, as well as the Forsaken.  She
      and Elayne have adopted each other as first-sisters.  Aviendha has a
      special ability in making wards against eavesdropping; it is unlikely
      even the Forsaken could breach one of her wards, and certainly no one
      could do so without her knowing it immediately.
      Aviendha was staying with Elayne at the Royal Palace in Caemlyn,
      but she was summoned away by the Wise Ones to complete her training.
      While in the Palace, she discovered a new Talent:  the ability to
      sense the function of a <I>ter'angreal</I> simply by holding it in her
      hands.  She is due to arrive at Rand's encampment with
      <A Href="#Rhuarc">Rhuarc</A> and much of the rest of her clan soon.

      she would not believe the Sun would come up unless she saw it herself,
      and if one morning it did not, she would just take it to confirm that
      she was correct to demand proof.  She was one of the six sisters in
      Salidar that had most of the authority, despite not being part of the
      Hall of the Tower, and later served as <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>'s
      advisor from the Gray Ajah.  Egwene was shocked to see she had returned
      to the Tower after Egwene was captured; she accused Beonin of betraying
      her, but Beonin denied it, and claims her oath still holds.
      She did, however, betray the spies sent to the Tower, though she claims
      she warned the spies from the Gray about it.
      Since her oath still holds, and by the Three Oaths Egwene knows she
      cannot lie, she has been conscripted to serve as Egwene's agent inside

      27&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah with iron-gray hair that she
      keeps in a bun.  She is handsome, not pretty.  She retired
      to a rose garden in northern Ghealdan, but has since left it due to the
      difficulty of growing decent roses with the weather the way it used to
      be.  She refused two appointments to the Hall of the Tower, when
      refusing even once is unheard of.  She also refused to become head of
      the Green Ajah.  It is said that she has had more Warders than most
      sisters have had shoes.  She has more strength than anyone in a thousand
      years except perhaps for <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> and
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>.  Although she is a Green, she has
      confronted and captured more men that can channel than any other woman;
      unknown to most, the men she captures tend to live longer after being
      gentled than the average.  She is somewhat of a living legend among Aes
      Sedai.  According to <A Href="#Min">Min</A>, Cadsuane will teach
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> and the Asha'man something&mdash;they will not
      like it, especially not from her, but they will have to learn it.  She
      is the oldest Aes Sedai alive.  Cadsuane wears many ornaments in her
      hair, all of which are <I>ter'angreal</I> she has collected over the
      years.  One of them is a reservoir&mdash;it &ldquo;stores&rdquo;
      <I>saidar</I> for later use in places where one might not be able to tap
      the Source, such as inside an Ogier <I>stedding</I> or inside Far
      Madding, her hometown.  Another vibrates in the presence of men who can
      channel; it is likely this ornament that has allowed her to capture so
      many men to be gentled.  There are many others, including three that she
      does not know the purpose of.  <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A> suspects
      Cadsuane may be a Darkfriend, but based on her actions and thoughts so
      far that seems unlikely.  <A Href="#Verin">Verin</A> told rand that she
      thinks Cadsuane can be trusted, and Verin is also not a Darkfriend.
      Cadsuane has, reluctantly, agreed to be Rand's advisor, provided he

      prison kept him from touching the world until it was bored into by Aes
      Sedai during the Age of Legends.  This hole, called the Bore, allowed
      the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new outbreaks of
      war, treachery, violence, and crime.  The attempt to free the Dark One
      completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the War of Power by
      some, especially those on the Shadow's side), during which a number of
      important leaders forsook the Light and gave their lives to the Dark
      One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of the

      itself, the male half of the True Source, dooming all male Aes Sedai to
      madness as well and starting the Time of Madness.  These seals are
      weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the Dark One is
      once again able to exert influence on the world.  These seals were
      scattered throughout the world by Aes Sedai during the Breaking of the
      World.  In order of when they were discovered, they were found:  1) At
      the Eye of the World (broken when it was found); 2) in the hands of
      <A Href="#Domon">Bayle Domon</A>, later pilfered by

      Tear (still intact); 5) In the Panarch's Palace in Tanchico (broken

      She is round, and has a deep voice for a woman and pale silver-colored

      trouble in the Hall, especially with her demand to make a

      was willing to discuss any subject in the Hall, whereas most Sitters

      Forsaken.  He is handsome, with a hawk-like nose and dark hair.
      Second-best seems to be the story of his life.
      He was born Barid Bel Medar one day after
      <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A>, and from the first day
      proceeded to almost equal Lews Therin's accomplishments, almost equal
      Lews Therin's strength, and almost equal him but never surpass him in
      everything.  He became one of the Light's greatest generals, once again
      second in command under Lews Therin.  Demandred believed that he was
      Lews Therin's intellectual and military superior, and was furious when
      Lews Therin was chosen to lead the Light's forces over him during the
      War of the Shadow.  He developed a burning hatred of Lews Therin, and
      finally dedicated his life to the Shadow so he could finally better Lews
      Therin&mdash;he believed the Shadow would eventually win the war, since
      Lews Therin was commanding the Light's armies, and that if he, Barid Bel
      Medar, had been chosen to command them, the Light would have prevailed.
      When Demandred was freed from the Bore, he transferred his hatred of
      Lews Therin intact to the new recipient of his soul,
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>.  Demandred was recently told by the
      <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A> to lead his plan to convert or destroy
      Rand, and promised him to be <A Href="#Naeblis">Nae'blis</A> if he
      succeeded.  However, since <A Href="#Moridin">Moridin</A> has been
      declared Nae'blis, he is now only ordered to obey Moridin.  Demandred's
      assumed identity and whereabouts are unknown,
      but he has formed an alliance of sorts with

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A>, p. 51&mdash;Young
      woman from Emond's Field and daughter of the innkeeper there,
      now raised to the <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin
      Seat</A> among the Aes Sedai opposing <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>.  She
      has considerable strength with the One Power, and will most likely be
      one of the strongest Aes Sedai in over a thousand years.  She is also
      the first Dreamer in the Tower in almost 500 years; she trained with the
      Wise Ones to learn more of this Talent.
      Before her time with the Wise Ones, she was sold by
      <A Href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</A> to <A Href="#Suroth">Suroth</A> to be
      made <I>damane</I>.
      She was held captive under the name
      <A Href="../book2/chron.html#Tuli">Tuli</A>
      under care of the <I>sul'dam</I> <A Href="#Renna">Renna Emain</A>.
      When Egwene escaped, she left Renna with her <I>a'dam</I> in place;
      the fact that Renna was bound by the <I>a'dam</I> threatens to destroy
      the foundation of Seanchan society, especially their enslavement of
      women who can channel.  Egwene is good friends with
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</A>, the Daughter-Heir of Andor, and is
      also a childhood friend of <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, the
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  In fact, Rand and Egwene were all
      but Promised in their youth, but both of them feel an almost
      sibling-like love for each other now; they know that they cannot get
      married, and do not want to.  Egwene is the love object of both of
      Elayne's brothers, <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A> and
      <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>&mdash;she is flattered by Galad's attentions,
      but she does not return them. She does find Gawyn to her liking, and had
      a dream of bonding him as her Warder; she knows it will occur.  Egwene
      was most likely chosen Amyrlin because she was in the Aiel Waste when
      the rebellion occurred, and because the Aes Sedai thought she could be
      manipulated by them without too much trouble;
      if this was their intent, they
      made a grave mistake, for Egwene promises to be one of the strongest
      Amyrlins in history.  Egwene has enlisted <A Href="#Bryne">Gareth
      Bryne</A> as the commander of her army to invade Tar Valon and remove
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A> from power.
      She has also opened the novice books to all
      interested women for the first time in history&mdash;in the past, they
      were only open to girls of a certain age, for fear that older women
      would not be able to handle the discipline.  This policy has increased
      the size of the rebel Tower to several times the size of the original,
      unified one.  The number of novices has increased to levels not known
      for over a thousand years.  Egwene has also discovered many lost Talents
      of the Age of Legends, such as Dreaming, Traveling, and the making of
      <I>cuendillar</I>.  She was guided to Dreaming by the Wise Ones, with
      whom she studied in the Aiel Waste, and was guided to the making of
      <I>cuendillar</I> by <A Href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</A> while she was
      captured, but Traveling was her discovery alone.  She has recovered
      some other abilities through Moghedien as well.  She plans to reunite
      the Tower and make it stronger than ever&mdash;and she plans to start by
      exiling Elaida, as she will not unite the Tower, only shatter it into
      fragments that will never be gathered up again.
      Egwene was captured by sisters loyal to Elaida after executing her plan
      to block the harbor by turning the harbor chain to <I>cuendillar</I>.
      She is now a prisoner in the Tower, and has been re-enlisted as a Novice
      again.  She accepts all punishments Elaida and others impose upon her
      for insisting that she is still the Amyrlin Seat and still Aes Sedai.
      Her strong will and persistence have earned her the respect of nearly
      all the novices and perhaps several of the Accepted as well.
      Egwene plans to subvert Elaida from the inside by making suggestions and
      hinting that various things Elaida has done are indefinsible; she speaks
      to anyone that seems willing to ponder those suggestions.
      More urgently, Egwene is attempting to convince the Hall&mdash;both the
      Hall in Tar Valon and the Hall in Exile&mdash;that they must be prepared
      for the Seanchan attack she knows is imminent.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Nynaeve">el'Nynaeve ti al'Meara Mandragoran</A>,
      p. 84&mdash;Young woman from Emond's Field, now an Aes Sedai
      of the Yellow Ajah.  She was the Wisdom of her village, the youngest
      such ever chosen in Emond's Field.  She left when four of her villagers
      were taken away from the Two Rivers by <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>
      and <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>.  While the group traveled away from her home
      and toward her new life, Nynaeve made several discoveries:  she could
      channel the One Power, and had already done so without really knowing
      what she was doing; she developed feelings for Lan Mandragoran,
      Moiraine's Warder and the uncrowned king of the now dead nation Malkier;
      and she has a major role to play, as all of her younger friends in the
      group do, in the years to come.  She is very strong in the One Power;
      only a select few who were alive during the Age of Legends could match
      her as well as a few young women still being trained.  When she arrived
      in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a novice,
      despite not being able to even <Em>sense</Em> the True Source unless
      angry, a result of her having to learn some minimal control of her
      ability without teaching.  She was sent on a false mission by
      <A Href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</A> on which she was almost leashed by the
      Seanchan as <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> was.  After she returned to the
      Tower, <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> sent her on a mission to hunt
      down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in
      Tanchico, she encountered <A Href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</A> and managed
      to better her in a duel of the Power.  Moghedien escaped, but two
      encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her,
      leashing her with an <I>a'dam</I> in <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>.  Nynaeve
      took Moghedien with her to seek out <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> and
      <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A> while they were fighting each other, and at
      the last moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin
      to ash with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could
      draw to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain
      control of himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire.  Nynaeve then kept
      Moghedien under control with a modified <I>a'dam</I> in Salidar until
      <A Href="#Halima">Halima</A> helped her escape.
      Nynaeve wished to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she
      thinks the Tower meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and
      wants no part of it.  She is determined to Heal anything short of death,
      and has already managed to Heal gentling.  Nynaeve felt bad when
      Moiraine died, because her first thought was not of her, but that now
      Lan was free from their bond.  She was not told that Lan's bond had been
      passed to <A Href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</A> at the moment of Moiraine's
      death.  She and Lan are now married, and the plan is for Lan's bond to
      pass to her as soon as she and Myrelle can get together.  As Lan's wife,
      she will become the Queen of Malkier when Lan raises the Golden
      Crane and frees Malkier from the Blight.  She now wears the
      <I>ki'sain</I>, an ornament traditionally worn by Malkieri wives,
      consisting of a dot on the forehead between the eyes&mdash;Lan did not
      tell her of this tradition, but when she found out she immediately took
      it up.  It is the one element of her appearance that never fades for one
      second when every other part changes faster than the eye can follow in
      <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>.  Because she was the only person Rand felt he
      could trust to link with him and the Choedan Kal, he asked Nynaeve to
      assist him when he cleansed <I>saidin</I>.  She now carries the
      <I>ter'angreal</I> she found in Ebou Dar nearly all the time,
      making her collection of jewelry rival that of
      <A Href="#Cadsuane">Cadsuane</A>.
      She is even rumored to leave much of this jewelry on even when sleeping.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</A>, p.
      62&mdash;Aes Sedai formerly of the Red Ajah, now raised to the
      <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A> in Tar Valon.  She was born the
      youngest daughter of a minor House in the north of Murandy.  She
      occasionally has the Foretelling, and as a result of a Foretelling she
      had concerning the importance of the Royal Family of Andor in Tarmon
      Gaidon, she served as advisor to <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A> of
      Andor for her entire reign.  She later led the coup that deposed
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> and placed herself on the Amyrlin Seat
      in Siuan's place.  She distrusts anyone not of the Red Ajah (as most
      Reds do), and does not think she will ever be able to trust any member
      of the Blue Ajah again.
      Her <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A> was
      <A Href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</A> of the White Ajah&mdash;she
      was all but forced to choose Alviarin due to her role in the deposition
      of Siuan.  If she chose a Keeper from her Ajah, she most likely would
      not have won the support of the White Ajah, and then <I>she</I> would
      have been stilled and banished from the Tower instead of Siuan.
      Her Foretelling about the importance of Andor's royal family
      during the Last Battle occurred around the time the Succession was going
      on, so she immediately attached herself to Morgase as soon as it became
      clear that she would be the one to take the Lion Throne.  Another of her
      Foretellings was to predict that <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> would
      shake the world on its very foundations&mdash;she constantly kicks
      herself for not doing something about him when he was right in front
      of her, little more than a farmboy at the time.
      Her most recent Foretelling was that &ldquo;the White Tower would be
      whole again, except for remnants cast out and scorned,
      whole and stronger than ever.
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> will face the Amyrlin Seat and know her
      anger.  The Black Tower will be rent in blood and fire, and sisters will
      walk its grounds.&rdquo;  The Foretelling about Rand is obviously deadly
      accurate.  However, the one about the Royal Family occurred at an
      inopportune time; at the time of Elaida's Foretelling, the Royal Family
      was not certain.  It may have meant Morgase,
      <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>, <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A>, and
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> (they have all had a large role to play in
      the recent past), but it is also possible it could have meant the old
      Royal Family, that of <A Href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</A>,
      <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail</A>, Galad, and later Elayne and Gawyn as
      well.  After all, Morgase is just Morgase, but Tigraine is the mother of
      the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  Her most recent Foretelling
      will of course be fulfilled, but not necessarily how she wants it to be;
      she does not realize that the Amyrlin Seat in the Foretelling might not
      be her, that the remnants cast out might be those loyal to her, and that
      the destruction of the Black Tower might have nothing to do with her.
      Elaida is quite strong in the One Power; only Siuan (before she was
      still and Healed), <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>,
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>, <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>,
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>, and a few others could match her
      strength.  Elaida has always sought positions of power; she chose to
      follow Morgase to have a better chance at guiding the forces in the Last
      Battle, and tried to capture Rand al'Thor in an effort to gain similar
      control.  The only sisters that support her are those that are actually
      Black Ajah and those that would follow any Amyrlin legally raised, as
      Elaida was (although just barely; all laws used to raise her were
      stretched almost to their breaking point, and some believe they actually
      <I>did</I> shatter).  Elaida is currently building a palace for herself
      atop the Warders' old practice yard.  The building will be about as tall
      as the White Tower.  She has no plans on being merciful on those who
      rebelled against her when she deposed Siuan&mdash;her terms are that the
      Blue Ajah no longer exists, and that any sister following Egwene must
      serve penance under her personal guidance before being readmitted to the
      Tower.  Elaida has since replaced Alviarin as Keeper with a sister of
      the Red Ajah, <A Href="#Tarna">Tarna Feir</A>,
      and she has suspicions that Alviarin was trying to commit treason
      against the Tower.
      She ordered <A Href="#Seaine">Seaine Herimon</A> to &ldquo;follow the
      trail of treason&rdquo; as far as it went, even to the Keeper herself.
      Seaine interpreted this as a charge to capture members of the Black
      Ajah, leading to a grave situation for Seaine, as she now has several
      Black sisters that she has uncovered and no longer feels she can trust
      Elaida.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Elayne">Elayne Trakand</A>, p.
      56&mdash;Daughter-Heir of Andor, now Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah.  She
      is the daughter of <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A> and her late husband,
      <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</A>, and sister to
      <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>.  She is also half-sister to
      <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A>, although she would rather not be reminded of
      this fact; she thinks Galad virtuous to the point of fault, and does not
      really like him.  She has considerable potential in the One Power, and
      is one of the strongest Aes Sedai in a thousand years or more,
      possibly since the Age of Legends, with the exceptions of
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>, <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>,
      <A Href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</A>, and some trainees.  She has
      red-gold curly hair.  During her stay in the Stone of Tear, Elayne
      realized she loved <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, and told him how
      she felt; he felt similarly.  She had no idea at the time what
      <A Href="#Min">Min</A> meant about &ldquo;having to share him,&rdquo;
      but now knows about Min's viewing of Rand with the three women's heads,
      indicating that Rand will fall in love with Min, Elayne, and Aviendha,
      and they with him.  Later, when she and Nynaeve had trouble with
      <A Href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</A>, Elayne ended up bonding
      <A Href="#Birgitte">Birgitte</A> as her Warder (despite being only
      Accepted at the time) in order to save Birgitte's life.  Elayne later
      went to Ebou Dar and found the Bowl of the Winds, a <I>ter'angreal</I>
      that they used to fix the weather.  She has since returned to Andor upon
      hearing news of her mother's disappearance; she plans to take the Lion
      Throne, as soon as she has garnered enough support to keep it.
      She recently ended <A Href="#Arymilla">Arymilla</A>'s campaign for the
      Throne, which convinced all but one of the necessary nobles to support
      her for the Lion Throne.
      During that campaign, Elayne was captured by the Black Ajah,
      though Birgitte convinced the Windfinders to help rescue her.
      In the
      meantime, Elayne has managed to reproduce several <I>ter'angreal</I>,
      something which no one else has been able to do since the Breaking of
      the World, as well as discover a way to share a Warder bond between
      three women; she bonded Rand along with Aviendha, her new sister by Aiel
      tradition, and Min.  Shortly after bonding Rand, she became pregnant
      with Rand's twins.  To protect the children, she is not revealing the
      father of the twins.
      She is the first ruler of Andor to <I>ever</I> cede land to anyone:
      she agreed with the Sea Folk to cede a few square miles of Andor to them
      in exchange for their help feeding the city during the siege.
      She also sends Andoran troops to the Black Tower (which is on Andoran
      soil) periodically to remind its inhabitants that they are still within
      Andor and subject to its laws.
      She is proving to be a capable leader,
      one her people may eventually be quite proud of.  <I>See also</I>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Min">Elmindreda (Min) Farshaw</A>, p.
      53&mdash;Young woman from Baerlon.
      She is lithe and slight of build,
      and keeps her dark hair in short ringlets.
      She has dark, deep, worried-looking eyes.
      She has a special ability that few
      besides herself know about:  she sees images and auras around people,
      especially around Aes Sedai, Warders, and Asha'man, that foretell their
      futures.  Min does not always know what these viewings mean, but when
      she does, it <I>will</I> happen; it is only a question of how and when.
      Min was fascinated by the number of images she saw around
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>, especially the one she saw that included
      herself:  he was destined to fall in love with three different women,
      one of which was herself.  She usually dresses in attire reserved for
      men; this habit was picked up when growing up with her father, who was a
      miner.  However, once she started to develop feelings for Rand, she
      began to wear more traditionally feminine attire&mdash;still coat and
      trousers, but cut to emphasize female characteristics.
      Min was in Tar Valon
      helping <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A> with her viewings' information when
      Siuan was deposed, and it was Min that freed Siuan and
      <A Href="#Leane">Leane</A> from the dungeon.  She accompanied the two
      former leaders of the Aes Sedai to Salidar; once there, she left for
      Caemlyn with Salidar's embassy to Rand.  Once in Caemlyn, she brought
      information to Rand about the embassy there, and its intentions.  She
      has only had one viewing that ever failed, which concerned
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>; since Moiraine is believed dead, she
      hopes that her viewings might be wrong at least once in a while.  Min is
      one of only three women that can rightfully call herself a lover to the
      <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon Reborn</A>, and she is now bonded to Rand via a
      Warder bond that she shares with the other two,
      <A Href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</A> and <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>.  She
      is fond of reading books by the late <A Href="#Fel">Herid Fel</A>, a
      philosopher who worked in Rand's school of thought and was killed by a
      <I>gholam</I> or Slayer, presumably because he had stumbled upon
      information crucial to the defeat of the Shadow.  She had a viewing of
      Elayne just before the door closed that Elayne would become pregnant
      with twins; she told half the palace before Elayne herself knew.&hellip;

      Her two older brothers were killed, and when Davram sent her younger
      brother off to fight while keeping her at home, she ran away and swore
      the oath of a Hunter of the Horn in Illian.  When she became a Hunter,
      she renounced her old name, Zarine, at first considering adopting the
      name &ldquo;Mandarb&rdquo;&mdash;she chose Faile when she found that
      <A Href="#Mandarb">Mandarb</A> was the name of <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>'s
      horse.  She fell in love with <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A> while

      She was shocked, but even more so to find out that
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> was the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> and
      that both he and Perrin are <I>ta'veren</I>.  Faile stayed near Perrin,
      and finally accompanied him to the Two Rivers where she helped fend off
      the Trolloc attacks; the two were married shortly afterwards.  They were
      then proclaimed Lord and Lady of the Two Rivers.  Perrin hated the idea,
      but Faile insisted they have a modest estate, and even servants, which
      she trained herself.  Her name means &ldquo;falcon&rdquo; in the Old

      Min had no intentions toward him.  She left with Perrin for Ghealdan to

      <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A>'s return, he gave her her kingdom in one
      piece, as it was when she left.  Allegedly, she was so happy that he had

      <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>'s trip through Caemlyn to deliver

      someone to kill Elayne and anyone else with her&mdash;he tried to find a
      way to report this information to Morgase, but ended up telling Elayne.
      Gaebril was discovered to be <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A>, one
      of the Forsaken, who has a preference to having pretty women around him.
      His &ldquo;pretty woman&rdquo; was Morgase, and he planned to wrest

      left the country so quickly a rumor sprang up that she had been killed;
      when Caemlyn was taken by <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> and Rahvin killed,

      she speaks to him, and Aes Sedai often forsook their work to watch
      him practice (shirtless) in the sword yard when he was in training.
      Galad has much skill with the sword,
      and has achieved Blademaster status in practice if not in name.
      He disappeared from Tar Valon during the violence that
      accompanied <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A>'s deposition and joined
      <A Href="#Valda">Eamon Valda</A>'s band of the Children of the Light.
      Because of his sword skill, Galad was promoted to an official position
      very quickly, and now controls his own small band of men.  He says he
      became a Whitecloak because it &ldquo;felt right.&rdquo;  He is extremely
      virtuous, and will do whatever he thinks is right regardless of who it
      hurts, even himself.  In fact, he started a war in Samara to help Elayne
      and Nynaeve escape.  His sign is a winged silver sword, point down.
      Galad has feelings for <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A>, and
      although she is flattered by his attentions, she doesn't return his
      love.  He is quite popular among his soldiers.  Galad believes,
      incorrectly, that <A Href="#Valda">Eamon Valda</A> killed his mother
      after sexually abusing her, and killed him in punishment for this.
      According to <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s visions of

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Galina">Galina Casban</A>, p. 607&mdash;Former
      head of the Red Ajah, now taken prisoner by the Shaido.  She has
      actually been of the Black Ajah for all but five of her almost ninety
      years wearing the shawl; she is of high standing among the Black
      sisters.  Galina has long black hair without a touch of gray in it.
      She is pretty, but nowhere near beautiful.
      She led the expedition to bring <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> to
      Tar Valon after he was shielded.  She was captured by the Shaido after
      the battle at Dumai's Wells, and became a prisoner of
      <A Href="#Sevanna">Sevanna</A> and <A Href="#Therava">Therava</A>.
      She claims to have helped break two
      <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin</A>'s as a Black sister&mdash;one
      (<A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>) was deposed and stilled, and the
      other (<A Href="#Tamra">Tamra Ospenya</A>) was made to appear that she
      had died in her sleep.  She led the circle that stilled Siuan.
      <A Href="#Pevara">Pevara</A> firmly did not want to believe that Galina
      was Black, despite <A Href="#Talene">Talene</A>'s suspicions that she
      was.  When Galina's loyalties were proven, presumably by an
      inconsistency between her notes and her actions, Pevara went into a rage
      for a full day and now vows to strangle Galina with her bare hands.
      Galina attempted to escape Sevanna's captivity by exploiting a loophole
      in the oath she was forced to swear on a binder (similar to the Oath
      Rod):  she made <A Href="#Faile">Faile</A> acquire the rod for her and
      give it to her (since she was forced to swear an oath to never steal it)
      and then betrayed Faile and fled.  She was captured by Therava and
      ordered never to attempt to escape again; by her Oath, she is now
      Therava's slave forever.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Bryne">Gareth Bryne</A>, p. 93&mdash;Former First
      Prince of the Sword and Captain of the Queen's Guards under
      <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A> in Andor.  He was appointed to the
      position because Morgase had no living male relatives, but was exiled
      from Caemlyn on a suggestion from Morgase's new advisor,
      <A Href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</A>.  He moved to his private estates in
      rural Andor, where he later presided over the trial of three young
      women who unintentionally burned a barn: they turned out to be
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>, the former <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin
      Seat</A>; <A Href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</A>, the former
      <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A>, and
      <A Href="#Min">Min Farshaw</A>.  When these three made an oath to serve
      him and then apparently broke it, he followed them out of sheer
      curiosity to Salidar.  Once there, he discovered the true identity of
      the three, as well as that the Tower was truly broken.  The Aes Sedai in
      Salidar persuaded him to command the army they would need to take the
      Amyrlin Seat from <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>, since he was the only
      commander that the Warders thought would be willing and able to help
      them.  He is one of the six best military commanders west of the Aiel
      Waste, in a league with <A Href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</A>,
      <A Href="#Rodel">Rodel Ituralde</A>, <A Href="#Bashere">Davram
      Bashere</A>, <A Href="#Agelmar">Agelmar Jagad</A>, and
      <A Href="#Mat">Matrim Cauthon</A>.  Although neither of them would admit
      it, Bryne seems to be developing feelings for Siuan Sanche; he wishes to
      avoid another mistake like his relationship as
      <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A>'s lover, and also never forgave Siuan for
      when she publicly shamed him years ago.  She seems to be developing
      similar feelings for him, much to her dismay.  He plans to be the
      first general to take the city of Tar Valon; the closest anyone else has
      ever come was with <A Href="#Guaire">Guaire Amalasan</A>'s armies, who
      got as far as the White Tower itself, and <A Href="#Hawkwing">Artur
      Hawkwing</A>, who never managed to go beyond beseiging the city.
      Actually, Amalasan's troops never beseiged the city, they simply managed
      to breech the walls; Hawkwing never managed to stop the supply ships
      coming up the river.  Bryne thought he will be able to overcome this
      problem by purchasing ships along the way to Tar Valon, but when
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> brought the entire army to Tar Valon by
      Traveling, that plan faltered; instead, he pressured her to let him
      use gateways to breach the walls and get inside the city.  He is stocky,
      with a bluff face.  The years have given him some sort of comforting
      calmness.  Men always follow him&mdash;they have learned from history
      that doing so is the path to military victory.  Bryne taught
      <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A> and <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A> to practice
      the sword with both hands alternating to avoid weakness.
      Bryne is currently besieging the city of Tar Valon.

      <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A> went to train with the Warders in the White
      Tower, as all sons of Andoran queens have for centuries, and both now
      possess considerable skill with the sword.  During the chaos that
      erupted after <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>'s deposition, Gawyn
      formed a band of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders
      except Galad, who are called the Younglings.  The Younglings fought back
      against their teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and
      <A Href="#Leane">Leane</A> from their imprisonment.  Gawyn himself
      killed <A Href="#Hammar">Hammar</A>
      and <A Href="#Coulin">Coulin</A>,
      the men in charge of teaching the sword and
      for his personal training, respectively, both of which were
      Blademasters&mdash;few Warders are as good as they were, and Gawyn
      managed to kill both of them.  With recent developments, Gawyn does not
      know which party to support&mdash;he believes that anyone who opposed
      Tower Law by trying to free Siuan and Leane was wrong, but at the same
      time he does not know all the facts surrounding the change in
      leadership.  In fact, his sister Elayne and her friends
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</A> and
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A> side with those
      who broke from the Tower, and Egwene, the woman he wants to marry, is
      their new leader.  He believes the rumor that <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>
      killed his mother, and only refrains from killing him because Egwene
      made him promise not to.  Gawyn has made many enemies inside and outside
      the Tower, just by leading the Younglings.  He detests Rand because he
      thinks Rand killed his mother (when in fact no one did), and there is no
      telling how he'll react when he finds out that Elayne actually does love
      Rand (and is carrying his twins).
      Gawyn currently leads the Younglings on harrying parties against the
      army besieging Tar Valon; he is starting to think that
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A> is merely sending him on missions to keep
      him out of her hair, so to speak.
      At one time, he had no problem with the fact that he had killed his
      former teachers&mdash;they were rebelling against a lawfully raised
      Amyrlin&mdash;but he has since begun to feel guilty, wondering if he had
      truly chosen the just side.  His sign is a white boar.

      After the Bore was drilled, she went through a change after she realized

      It worked&mdash;she usually slept on a pallet in Egwene's tent.
      She is stunningly beautiful, with big green eyes in a
      perfect face and a full, firm bosom.  As she is posing as a poorly
      educated serving girl, she forms her letters with the awkwardness of a
      young child.  She has developed a fondness for low-cut bodices.  She got
      sloppy about bossing Delana around in public, leading
      <A Href="#Romanda">Romanda</A> and others to believe that Delana and
      Halima are &ldquo;pillow friends.&rdquo;  Eventually, Romana saw the

      He was never really bound inside the Bore, and led the
      hidden forces of the Shadow for the three thousand odd years from the
      end of the War of the Shadow to the present.  He took credit for such
      things as convincing the then insane <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin

      Healing that might have saved his life, sending the Trollocs out of the
      Great Blight during the Trolloc Wars, and many other events in history
      that turned out poorly.  When the rest of the Forsaken were freed,
      Ishamael kept them away from eachother's throats.  He confronted
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> at the Eye of the World where he was severed
      from the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>'s bonds; he confronted him again

      for this, and she will eventually have to learn that he is much stronger
      than she is, and she needs to give him respect appropriate to that

      allied not only with the Nakai, but with the Reyn Aiel as well (who were
      not much better than blood enemies before the alliance was made).  He

      Sedai of the Red Ajah.  She has dark, slightly curly hair.
      Though she obviously keeps it secret, she is actually of the Black Ajah,
      and has been for twelve years.
      She was captured by <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> during the battle at
      Dumai's Wells, but escaped her captors,
      most likely with assistance from Darkfriends.
      She and <A Href="#Tarna">Tarna</A> took rooms in

      there.  She is among those who kidnapped <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>,

      Seat</A>.  The Keeper is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah the
      Amyrlin was raised from, and wears a stole of the color of her Ajah
      instead of the striped stole of the Amyrlin.  The post was held by
      <A Href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</A> of the Blue Ajah until a coup deposed
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> and stilled both Siuan and Leane.  Her
      successor was <A Href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</A>
      of the White Ajah, despite the fact that Siuan's successor was from the
      Red.  The Keeper for the Aes Sedai who fled the Tower when
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A> was raised Amyrlin now have a Keeper of the
      Chronicles of their own, <A Href="#Sheriam">Sheriam Bayanar</A> of the
      Blue Ajah.  In theory, the Keeper of the Chronicles serves the Amyrlin
      and speaks for the Amyrlin; she is all but separate from her Ajah,
      although less so than the Amyrlin Seat herself.  However, both of the
      current Keepers have tried to expand their powers over the Amyrlin they
      serve, although for vastly different reasons&mdash;Alviarin is
      essentially trying to weaken Elaida and have herself or another Black
      sister raised in her place after Elaida is deposed;
      Sheriam tries to overstep <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> because she has a
      hard time thinking of Egwene being anything more than the frightened
      novice that came to her study not so long ago.
      Alviarin has since been deposed and replaced by
      <A Href="#Tarna">Tarna Feir</A> of the Red Ajah.
      <!-- Sheriam was similarly deposed when she was exposed as being of
      the Black Ajah.  When Elaida was captured by the Seanchan and Egwene
      raised in her place, she chose <A Href="#Silviana">Silviana Brehon</A>
      of the Red Ajah to be her Keeper. -->

      herself, which means &ldquo;Daughter of the Night&rdquo; in the Old
      Tongue.  She was born
      <A Href="book5/chron.html#Mierin">Mierin Eronaile</A>, and was
      very strong in the One Power.  She worked at the Collam Daan, the
      primary facility for research into the One Power.  Her final discovery
      there was what she thought was a new source for the One Power, one that
      could be harnessed by men and women alike&mdash;this source turned out
      to be the emissions through a thin spot in the Pattern from the
      <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>'s prison.  She and another Aes Sedai named
      <A Href="book4/chron.html#Beidomon">Beidomon</A>
      bored into the prison, creating what is now referred to as
      simply the Bore, allowing the Dark One to touch the world again and
      leading to the War of the Shadow.  Around this time, Mierin formed a
      relationship with <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A>, who headed
      the forces of the Light against the Shadow and was the most powerful man
      she had found.  Lews Therin broke off the relationship when he found
      that she only wanted him for his power and authority and the possibility
      of power for herself through him.  Mierin never let go of him, and when
      he later met and married <A Href="#Ilyena">Ilyena Moerelle</A>, she
      tried to disrupt the wedding ceremony as well as split the two apart by
      any means.  Eventually she went to Shayol Ghul to dedicate her soul to
      the Shadow, most likely to finally get back at Lews Therin for leaving
      her.  She declared as her territory the World of Dreams,
      <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>, using it to ends now unknown.  She transferred
      her obsessive love intact to Lews Therin's soul's new body,
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, after being freed from the Bore.  She
      first appeared to him as a young woman named Selene, but disguised her
      appearance as a slightly less beautiful (but still stunning) woman.
      Almost a year later, Lanfear found that Rand had been
      &ldquo;unfaithful&rdquo; to her, and she tried to kill him.  Before she
      could, she was pushed through the twisted stone doorway
      <I>ter'angreal</I> leading to the lands of the Eelfinn by
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>, becoming trapped.  Lanfear has since

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Leane">Leane Sharif</A>, p. 78&mdash;Aes Sedai of
      the Green Ajah, formerly of the Blue.
      She grew up in Arad Doman, and has coppery skin.  Just
      as her family members were training her in the seductive ways of Domani
      women, Leane found that her life would take a different direction:  she
      could channel <I>saidar</I>, and would do so with or without teaching.
      She became an Aes Sedai, a member of the Blue Ajah, and was eventually
      raised to <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A> under
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>.  During the coup
      led by <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida a'Roihan</A> and
      <A Href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</A> that deposed Siuan, Leane was
      thrown in the dungeon and stilled.  Leane tried turning to her seductive
      side to try to replace what she lost in stilling; she was out of
      practice, but did well enough.  She eventually convinced the Aes Sedai
      in Salidar to let her stay with them and maintain the network of
      eyes-and-ears she kept in Tar Valon as Keeper.  She was later Healed by
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>, and restored to some of her former
      capacity for using the One Power.  The Hall of the Tower in Salidar
      decided that since she had been stilled, she was no longer Aes Sedai for
      that time and thus all of her titles and choice of Ajah were null and
      void.  Instead of petitioning to re-enter the Blue Ajah, she asked the
      Green Ajah if it would accept her; it did, and she became the first
      sister to ever switch Ajahs.  Her eyes-and-ears as Keeper are retained
      by her; she was the only Aes Sedai to plant spies in the city itself.
      These spies were very useful in determining both what is going on in Tar
      Valon and what the Ajahs were leaving out of their reports to
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>.  She has considerable strength with Earth,

      <I>cuendillar</I>, she was captured and is now being held in the
      dungeons below the Tower.
      She was allowed only one dress, the one in which she was captured,
      which she washed every third day in the remains of her bath water.

      <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A> back into his prison.  Unfortunately,
      during this stroke he was driven insane by the Dark One's touch,
      eventually killing his wife <A Href="#Ilyena">Ilyena</A>, his children,
      and everyone he loved, as well as anyone who carried a drop of his
      blood.  For this act, people remember him with a new name:

      <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A> gave him his sanity back long enough
      for him to realize what he had done; Lews Therin killed himself by
      drawing on <I>saidin</I> too heavily, causing a mountain to form on the
      spot where he stood.  This mountain is called Dragonmount, and is near
      the present-day city of Tar Valon.  It is unfortunate that the name of
      one of the greatest men to ever live is now synonymous with evil, for
      Lews Therin killed his family due to the Dark One's influence, but
      without Lews Therin there may not have been a world left in which to
      kill them.  Lews Therin's voice often speaks inside
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s head, offering advice or sobbing over lost
      women or ranting about killing men who can channel.  It even tries to
      seize control of <I>saidin</I> sometimes, much to Rand's
      fear&mdash;Rand is certain that Lews Therin cannot take control of
      <I>saidin</I> away from him if he seizes it first,
      but experience has shown that if Lews Therin seizes it first,
      Rand is at his mercy until he releases.

      <I>stedding</I> without permission from the Council of Elders.  He is
      fond of books and history, and is an excellent Treesinger.  He is
      writing a book about his travels with the three <I>ta'veren</I> he
      meets, <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A>,
      and <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A>.
      Loial was constantly afraid that his mother would find him and try to
      marry him off and settle him down; however,
      he does like his mother's choice of wives for him,
      <A Href="#Erith">Erith</A>.  He, like most of the Ogier,
      is sad that most humans do not remember the Ogier, and is horrified that
      some even think he is a Trolloc on first seeing him.
      Loial's mother did indeed catch up with him; he and Erith are now
      married.  He was last seen on his way back to Stedding Shangtai to speak
      to the Stump.  Loial is taking notes for a book, which will eventually
      catalog everything he has been through with the three <I>ta'veren</I>.

      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> the least, but after he found out that Rand was
      the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>, he went his own way, preaching
      of Rand's glory as the &ldquo;Lord Dragon Reborn.&rdquo;  Rand
      dispatched <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A> to bring Masema back into line.
      He was stark raving mad, and very dangerous. He even claimed that Masema
      Dagar was dead, and that he had been resurrected as the Prophet of the
      Dragon Reborn.  He is described as a dark, frowning man of average size
      with a faded arrow-scar on his cheek.  He cared nothing for appearances,
      least of all his own.  He had deep-set, almost black eyes.
      Shortly before his death, Masema remembered his days as Masema, how he
      had earned his sword on his thirteenth nameday,
      but those were only a blurring memory.
      Masema was killed by Perrin's wife <A Href="#Faile">Faile</A>;

      Perrin could not do what was necessary.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Mat">Matrim (Mat) Cauthon</A>, p. 36&mdash;Young
      man from Emond's Field.  He is <I>ta'veren</I>.  Along with his good
      friends, <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> and <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin
      Aybara</A>, he left home to escape the Trolloc attacks after
      Winternight.  On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger from Shadar
      Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which he carried
      with him for a long time.  He was separated from the dagger by Aes Sedai
      Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory sequence.  These
      gaps were filled and more when he passed through the twisted door to the
      land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three requests:  a foxhead
      medallion that protects him from women's channeling, a way out of the
      land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes that were the
      gaps in his memory.  Mat's <I>ta'veren</I> qualities manifest themselves
      particularly well with random events, such as dice games&mdash;he almost
      never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are weighted.  He has
      found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling, and along with his
      newfound memories he can win almost every battle he fights quite
      decisively.  He has four sisters, including <A Href="#Eldrin">Eldrin</A>
      and <A Href="#Bode">Bodewhin</A>, who were 17 and 16, respectively, when
      Mat left Emond's Field.  His
      father <A Href="#Abell">Abell</A> is one of the best archers in the Two
      Rivers, possibly in the World.  Mat has gotten in the habit of carrying
      concealed knives under his clothes in case he is attacked&mdash;his
      collection would surprise anyone.  In the Waste, he met a woman named
      Melindhra, a Maiden of the Spear from the Shaido Clan.  However, she was
      not the <A Href="#9Moons">Daughter of the Nine Moons</A>, who Mat is
      destined to marry according to the Aelfinn; besides, she tried to kill
      him on orders from her master among the Darkfriends.  Mat had to kill
      her to save his own skin, but regretted it deeply.  He also has a scar
      along his neck from where the Eelfinn tried to kill him&mdash;which was
      also in accordance with what the Aelfinn told him, that he is &ldquo;to
      die and live again.&rdquo;  He created an army called the Band of the
      Red Hand, after the army of <A Href="#Aemon">King Aemon</A> of old
      Manetheren, and served in a way as Rand's personal general&mdash;this
      worked well, since Mat seems to be a better general than even
      <A Href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</A>, who has earned his reputation as
      one of the best commanders alive.  Mat does not trust any Aes Sedai, and
      because of this refuses to take his foxhead medallion off even to take a
      bath.  Mat went to Ebou Dar to try to keep an eye on
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> and <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> and
      prevent them from getting themselves killed.  While there, he was
      cornered by <A Href="#Tylin">Queen Tylin</A>, who gave him little choice
      but to become her lover.  When the Sea Folk and the Seanchan did battle
      in the city, he made his escape, leaving Tylin tied up under the bed so
      it looked &ldquo;official&rdquo;&mdash;Tylin was found torn limb from
      limb, obviously by the <I>gholam</I> which was no doubt sent to kill
      Mat.  In the process of leaving, Mat also took several <I>sul'dam</I>
      and <I>damane</I> (who were subsequently freed from their collars), and
      even kidnapped <A Href="#Tuon">Tuon</A>, the <A Href="#9Moons">Daughter
      of the Nine Moons</A> herself.  Mat traveled with
      <A Href="#Luca">Valan Luca</A>'s show to keep out of Seanchan
      sight for quite some time.
      Tuon has now completed Mat's unwitting marriage ceremony;
      he is now among the highest of the Seanchan ruling class,
      despite his insistence that he will fight the Seanchan during any battle
      if such battle is necessary.

      and she took Moghedien to Shayol Ghul to be bound by a
      <I>coursouvra</I>, a Mind Trap, controlled by

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Moiraine">Moiraine Damodred</A>, p. 60&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Blue Ajah.  Born of a noble House in Cairhien, she is
      <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</A>'s youngest half-sister, and
      <A Href="#Laman">King Laman</A>'s niece.  She is considered short among
      her people, and the Cairhienin are already a short people.  When it was
      discovered that she had the ability to channel inborn, Moiraine went to
      Tar Valon to become an Aes Sedai.  Just before being raised to the
      shawl, she and her friend <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> witnessed
      <A Href="../book6/chron.html#Gitara">Gitara Moroso</A>'s
      Foretelling of the Rebirth of the
      <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>.  Moiraine and Siuan
      walked away from each other and did not speak to each other again (at
      least in public), but both held secret communication with each other and
      dedicated their lives to finding and guiding the
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  Moiraine found the young man she
      sought on Winternight in Emond's Field, a young man named
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, along with two more <I>ta'veren</I>,
      <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A> and <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A>,
      and two women with the spark of the Power inborn,
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A> and <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve
      al'Meara</A>.  When Moiraine was shortly raised to the shawl, she met
      <A Href="#Lan">al'Lan Mandragoran</A>, the uncrowned King of Malkier,
      who was fighting alone against the Shadow in the Borderlands;
      she eventually asked Lan to become her Warder, and he accepted.
      She is very strong in the Power,
      stronger than almost all living Aes Sedai before Egwene and Nynaeve
      came to the Tower.
      In the Stone of Tear, Moiraine confronted and killed the Forsaken
      <A Href="#Belal">Be'lal</A> with balefire, just before he would have
      killed Rand.  Later, after having an inkling of the future events from
      the testing <I>ter'angreal</I> for the Wise Ones, Moiraine managed to
      push the Forsaken <A Href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</A> through the twisted
      doorway <I>ter'angreal</I> into the land of the Eelfinn, trapping both
      her and Lanfear there.
      Moiraine is the subject of the only viewing <A Href="#Min">Min</A> has
      ever had that has not come true.  Min assumes it <I>cannot</I> come
      true, as Moiraine is dead, though she has not said yet what the viewing
      said she needed to do&mdash;only that Rand would almost certainly fail
      without her.
      According to a letter Moiraine wrote to <A Href="#Thom">Thom Merrilin</A>
      the day before her death, however, she lives on in the land of the Finn,
      but her bond with Lan has been severed.
      The same letter convinced <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A> to help Thom rescue
      her, though her vision in the <I>ter'angreal</I> apparently indicated
      disaster would result unless Mat <I>asked</I> to see the letter before
      Thom showed it to him.
      Other Aes Sedai consider Moirane a legend, not only for
      discovering the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> but for killing or
      trapping two of the Forsaken as well.  Despite her efforts, and for the
      most part, success, <A Href="#Cadsuane">Cadsuane</A> still thinks she
      &ldquo;bungled&rdquo; things with Rand.

      married <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</A>, a prince of
      Cairhien, to further solidify her claim to the Throne of Andor and keep
      peace between the two nations; when <A Href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</A>
      disappeared, Morgase made the best claim to succeed her, and married her
      widower to gain the support that would be gained by such action.
      Taringail was Elayne's and Gawyn's father; he died when they were young.
      Morgase has since gone through several lovers, including
      <A Href="#Thom">Thomdril Merrilin</A>, a former court-bard;
      <A Href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</A>, her First Prince of the Sword and
      Captain of the Guards; and most recently <A Href="#Gaebril">Lord
      Gaebril</A>, a man who led the faction that stilled the riots in Caemlyn
      that sprang up on Morgase's trip to Tar Valon to inquire about Elayne's
      whereabouts.  Thom was exiled from the city of Caemlyn when he started
      telling her what he really thought of some of her plans, her
      relationship with Bryne ebbed away until finally Gaebril told her to
      exile him too, and Gaebril eventually chased Morgase herself out of the
      city when she found he was usurping her power.  The Daughter-Heir of
      Andor is traditionally trained by Aes Sedai in the White Tower, and
      Morgase underwent novice training to keep the tradition alive.  She was
      given the gift of a Great Serpent ring despite not being Accepted, and
      still wears it on her left hand.  She was previously advised by
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</A> of the Red Ajah, who is
      now the <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A> in Tar Valon.  When Morgase
      discovered that Gaebril (who, unbeknownst to her, was actually
      <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A>) meant to usurp her throne, she left, and
      when she learned that the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> had taken
      over Caemlyn and none of her former supporters would give her aid, she
      fled to Amadicia to get help from the only place she thought she could:
      <A Href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</A> and the Children of the Light.  She
      was not aware that <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> only wanted to give her
      country back to her, not to mention believes that she is dead.  If she
      had made her presence known, she would no doubt have had her country
      back in one piece, but as royalty she believed she must work on her own
      and trust no one.  She went into hiding after the Seanchan attack
      (<A Href="#Valda">Eamon Valda</A>
      believes her to be dead) under her mother's first name,
      <A Href="#Maighdin">Maighdin</A> to avoid instant recognition, and later
      became a maidservant to <A Href="#Faile">Faile</A>; she told Faile that
      she was a lady's handmaid before coming into her service.  When Faile's
      group was captured, she became a prisoner of the Shaido, and is now
      detained in their encampment.  Her sign is three golden keys.  A former
      member of the Queen's Guard, <A Href="#Tallanvor">Martyn Tallanvor</A>,
      has taken a liking to his former queen, and she finds herself almost
      unconsciously returning his attentions.  Her adopted son
      <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A> believes her dead at the hands of Eamon
      Valda, and plans revenge on him.  Her son Gawyn believes her dead at the
      hands of the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>, and is only restrained
      from killing her by <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>'s command.  Her
      daughter Elayne believes her dead as well (though she as yet has no
      plans for vengeance), and her new mistress Faile has no idea of her true
      identity.

      but with a prominent chin that ruins the look
      (in <a href="#Graendal">Graendal</a>'s eyes, at least).  His name
      means &ldquo;Death&rdquo; in the Old Tongue; no one deserves the name
      more.  He is fond of using the True Power, the power drawn directly from
      the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>; the <I>saa</I> have already appeared
      in his eyes, yet he still controls his use of the True Power (most
      thought it impossible to avoid drawing too much of it once the
      <I>saa</I> appeared).  Moridin is careful not to attempt to force the
      Pattern to behave how he wants it to&mdash;he knows that with someone as
      strongly <I>ta'veren</I> as <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>, that is all but
      impossible, not to mention foolish.  Instead, he attempts to keep
      everything in chaos (as per the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>'s
      command, &ldquo;Let the Lord of Chaos Rule&rdquo;), hoping that subtle
      manipulations will further his goals.  He has been declared
      <A Href="#Naeblis">Nae'blis</A>, the one to be second only to the
      Great Lord of the Dark after the Last Battle, and given control of the
      <I>cour'souvra</I> controlling the minds of
      <A Href="#Cyndane">Cyndane</A> and <A Href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</A>.
      He has also been granted the exclusive privilege of using the True

      Their two streams of balefire crossed, causing both of their heads to

      exceeds that of all Aes Sedai currently alive, with the exception of
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>, <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>, and Nynaeve.
      She has a limited ability to make <I>cuendillar</I>, but she is
      impatient in learning.  She is very arrogant and can also be deceitful;
      she once tried to blackmail <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>,
      <A Href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</A>, and <A Href="#Nisao">Nisao</A>.  She
      used the fact that she could Foretell to be even more arrogant and
      demand even more special treatment.  When Egwene refused to grant her
      that treatment, she ran away to the White Tower, thinking they would let
      her progress at the pace she wanted.  She could not have been more
      incorrect, of course, and her life in the Tower is no doubt even more
      abysmal than it was before.  It will get even worse if a sister ever
      finds out that she lied about her age; she is too old to be entered into
      the novice book by traditional Tower law.
      When Egwene was captured, Nicola became one of her foremost adherents
      among the novices; Nicola has gathered enough support for Egwene amongst
      the novices that they support Egwene more than many of the sisters in
      the Tower.

      orders to locate the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> and narrowed
      the list of candidates to  to three boys in Emond's Field.  While
      persuing them, he encountered the spirit of
      <A Href="#Mordeth">Mordeth</A> in Aridhol, now called Shadar Logoth.
      Mordeth attempted to consume Fain's soul, but instead the two souls
      merged, producing something more evil than either of them alone.  Fain
      no longer takes his orders from the Shadow; he has his own evil agenda.
      It is said, &ldquo;The look of the Eyeless is fear,&rdquo; from
      observing that a Myrddraal's look causes fear in the hearts of men.
      Fain's look has that effect on Myrddraal&mdash;Fades feel the same fear
      of Fain as men feel from a Fade.  Fain is also called

      he and <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> got separated from the rest of the
      group while fleeing the Trollocs on Winternight, Perrin met a man named
      <A Href="#Elyas">Elyas Machera</A>.  Elyas, a former Warder who found he
      could talk to wolves, helped Perrin discover the same ability in
      himself.  Perrin's eyes are now yellow, just like the wolves' eyes, and
      he can enter what he calls the Wolf Dream (known to most as
      <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>, the World of Dreams) with them.  Perrin is a
      childhood friend of fellow <I>ta'veren</I>
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> and <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A>.  On
      the way to Tear, Perrin encountered a young woman by the name of
      <A Href="#Zarine">Zarine Bashere</A>, a Hunter for the Horn who
      took the name of <A Href="#Faile">Faile</A> (which means
      &ldquo;Falcon&rdquo; in the Old Tongue) as a more appropriate name for a
      Hunter for the Horn.  The two are now married.  Perrin is a very large
      man&mdash;he was always a big person, which caused him to be very
      cautious since he found as a child that he could easily hurt other
      children if his temper got out of hand.  His size helped considerably
      when helping <A Href="#Haral">Master Luhhan</A> on his forge, but
      sometimes gave others the impression that he is slow and stupid.  He
      returned to the Two Rivers for a time to repel the series of Trolloc
      attacks; he and his wife are recognized as Lord and Lady there, the
      first noblility of the Two Rivers since the Trolloc Wars.  When he
      returned, he began to draw the eye of <A Href="#Berelain">Berelain sur
      Paendrag Paeron</A>, the First of Mayene&mdash;Perrin wants nothing more
      than to be as far from her as possible, but Berelain will not take no
      for an answer, much to Faile's dismay and intense jealousy.  Perrin was
      instrumental in freeing Rand from his entrapment at Dumai's Wells; the
      two had a fight afterwards (they had planned it as a way for Perrin to
      leave, although they most likely did not plan on it being as violent as
      it was), and Perrin went to Ghealdan to see if he could tame
      <A Href="#Masema">Masema</A>.  On the way, his wife was captured by
      Shaido, and he spent weeks single-mindedly trying to track her down.
      He eventually formed an alliance with <A Href="#Khirgan">Tylee
      Khirgan</A>, a Seanchan Banner-General, to help him defeat the Shaido
      and free his wife.
      Despite his strong desires to avoid both combat and lordship,
      Perrin has become a very good general and leader.  <I>See also</I>

      would make a Red sister's job easier.  She and her friend since
      novicehood, <A Href="#Seaine">Seaine</A>, began a hunt for Darkfriends
      in the Tower.  Seaine approached her not only because they were friends,
      but because Seaine's family was killed by Darkfriends when she was
      young.  She joined the Red Ajah because its task was one which involved
      being outside the Tower often, and she considered it more likely to be
      able to find and bring to justice the Darkfriends that killed her family
      and others like them.  She now leads the organization of sisters in the
      White Tower to ferret out Black sisters, along with
      <A Href="#Saerin">Saerin Sedai</A>, who seized control away from
      Seaine as soon as she knew what they were about.
      Pevara myseriously disappeared from the Tower&mdash;in reality,
      she was one of the sisters leading the embassy of sorts to the Black
      Tower in which Red sisters offered to bond Asha'man as Warders.

      accordance with prophecy; &ldquo;born of a Maiden, of the ancient blood

      palms, which he received from the sword Tam gave him while fighting
      <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A>.  He also has two

      <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A>, who was obviously of equal
      strength), and is also <I>ta'veren</I>, the most strongly so since Lews
      Therin as well.  Lews Therin's voice has somehow found a new place
      inside of Rand's head; he talks to him in a mad voice when Rand least
      expects it, sometimes offering sound advice or knowledge, sometimes
      babbling, sometimes even trying to wrest control of <I>saidin</I> from
      him.  Unlike Lews Therin, Rand is accompanied by two other
      <I>ta'veren</I> during his turing of the Wheel, two men born within days
      (hours, even) of him named <A Href="#Mat">Matrim Cauthon</A> and
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A>, who both grew up in Emond's Field
      as well.  Rand is destined to fall in love with three women (and has):

      and <A Href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</A>.  Rand has had success in fighting

      <A Href="#Balthamel">Balthamel</A>; he allowed

      wagons near the Spine of the World, <A Href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</A>
      confronted him and was pushed into the land of the Eelfinn by Moiraine;
      he killed <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A> in <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I> when he
      came to the Royal Palace in Caemlyn;
      <A Href="#Asmodean">Asmodean</A>, his teacher, was killed shortly after
      Rahvin met his fate; <A Href="#Sammael">Sammael</A> met his fate while
      fighting Rand in Shadar Logoth at the hands of Mashadar;
      <A Href="#Osan">Osan'gar</A>, the reincarnation of
      <A Href="#Aginor">Aginor</A>, died at Shador Logoth when Rand was
      cleansing <I>saidin</I>;
      and <A Href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</A> was captured during her attempt
      to capture Rand and bind him with a male <I>a'dam</I>.
      During his duel with Sammael, Rand encountered
      a mysterious wanderer, presumably <A Href="#Moridin">Moridin</A>, who
      helped him.  During the fighting, their streams of balefire collided,
      causing Rand's head to spin and both of them to lose coherency for a
      while.  Ever since that time, Rand has had trouble seizing
      <I>saidin</I>; it is not known if this is because of Moridin's presumed
      use of the True Power, or something else.
      During his fight with Semirhage,
      Rand had his hand burned away by her weave of Fire;
      Moridin has since been seen favoring his left hand,
      as if Rand's injury is somehow affecting him.
      Since the hand cannot be repaired,
      Rand has moved on without it&mdash;others have compared it to the
      reaction one might have after losing a glove.
      Rand has steeled himself to do what he must,
      without emotional influence, without distraction from feelings.
      Rand's prophecies fulfilled grow:  he has already
      been born on the slopes of Dragonmount of a Maiden, of the ancient blood
      but raised by the old, taken the Stone of Tear and drawn
      <I>Callandor</I>, and began conquering &ldquo;under the forgotten
      symbol,&rdquo; that of the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  He is
      working on having the &ldquo;spotless tower&rdquo; (i.e., the White
      Tower) break and bend knee to him (the Tower has broken, and several Aes
      Sedai have sworn fealty to him and only him).  He recently used the
      Choedan Kal, the two great <I>sa'angreal</I> created during the War of
      the Shadow, to cleanse the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>'s taint from
      <I>saidin</I>.  He has created schools of sorts, more research
      universities, where some of the best inventors of the day have
      congregated near Cairhien, Caemlyn, and Tear to develop new technology.
      Rand has also created the Asha'man, men who came for his
      &ldquo;amnesty&rdquo; for male channelers.  With <I>saidin</I> cleansed,
      the Asha'man are now safe from the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>'s taint.
      The Asha'man themselves are not free from the Dark One's
      <Em>influence</Em>, however; there are many Darkfriends among the
      Asha'man, including <A Href="#Taim">Mazrim Taim</A>, the leader of the
      Black Tower.  The Asha'man under Taim have turned on Rand, trying to
      kill him and worse, though Rand does not at this point know that they
      were acting with Taim's knowledge.  Rand is the salvation of the entire
      world, and as the prophecy states, he <Em>will</Em> save the
      world&mdash;and Break it again.  <I>See also</I>

      She assisted in <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s kidnapping,

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Seaine">Seaine Herimon</A>, p. 204&mdash;Sitter
      for the White Ajah in Tar Valon.  She grew up in Altara, and has a

      and eyebrows and watery eyes.
      She was the daughter of a Lugard furniture maker,
      and is a bit above average height.  When the Hall was arguing
      over who to raise as <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin</A> years back, it was
      deadlocked over four candidates who had each worn the shawl about fifty
      years; the Hall wanted an Amyrlin that was younger than the eighty or
      more years than were common.  Seaine suggested <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan
      Sanche</A>, then a young Blue sister that had worn the shawl for only
      ten years; she was eventually raised.  Later, Seaine was charged by
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A> to find Darkfriends in the Tower; Elaida
      hopes to expose <A Href="#Alviarin">Alviarin</A> on the suspicion that
      she is Black Ajah.  She and her friend since novicehood,
      <A Href="#Pevara">Pevara</A>, have successfully captured and bound with
      the Oath Rod a member of the Black Ajah, and have since dug out more
      Black sisters, even revealing that <A Href="#Galina">Galina Casban</A>,
      head of the Red Ajah herself, was secretly Black.
      Seaine recently found that she was set to her task because of a
      misunderstanding:  Elaida asked her how she was getting along
      &ldquo;with discovering proof that Alviarin entered a treasonous
      correspondence with the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.
      Elaida's exact words were, &ldquo;We can never be sure who has the
      shadow of treason in her heart, Seaine.  Why, I suspect that someone
      arranged for an order of mine to be countermanded.  And I have reason
      to believe that someone has communicated privately with
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>; to what end, I cannot say,
      but that surely is treason against me, and against the Tower.
      I charge you to follow the stench of treason,
      no matter where it leads or how high,
      even to the <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper</A> herself.  Yes, even to her.
      What you find, whoever it leads to,
      you will bring before the <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A> alone,
      Seaine.  No one else must know.&rdquo;
      Seaine interpreted this to mean Darkfriends in the Tower,
      and therefore assumed Elaida could not be a Darkfriend.
      She and her associates are no longer so sure.

      Forsaken.  During the Age of Legends, she was one of the
      best Healers ever known.  She was called to all corners of the world
      Heal people that others thought beyond help.  However, she was sadistic;
      she exacted a price in the form of pain from her subjects in return for
      her Healing services.  Most thought the pain or anguish she exacted from
      them was a small price to pay for being alive, but eventually the Hall
      of Servants found out about her practices and gave her the choice of
      being either severed or bound with the Power, never again to know her
      &ldquo;pleasures.&rdquo;  She chose instead to pledge for the
      <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>, and created one of the most oppressive and
      pain-filled areas of Shadow control during the entire War of Power.
      She became an expert at sadism and torture; she considers her greatest
      achievement to be a weave which removes the victim's blood and replaces
      it, instantaneously, with another liquid that causes every nerve in the
      body to fire with pain simultaneously&mdash;the victims typically
      survived about an hour.
      After being freed from the Bore, Semirhage went in service to the Dark
      One by extracting information from captured Borderlanders and Aes Sedai.
      She also sent the Trollocs to the Stone of Tear to battle those that
      <A Href="#Sammael">Sammael</A> sent.  She is as tall as most men, and
      wears black most of the time&mdash;perhaps because
      <A Href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</A> always wore white.  It is often joked (or
      used to be, when the Forsaken were still bound) that when it rained
      during the daylight that the Dark One was beating her.
      According to <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin</A>'s memories,
      Semirhage always enjoyed a challenge.

      that joined her) through Ghealdan, where they were sent from Kinslayer's
      Dagger by <A Href="#Sammael">Sammael</A>.  She constantly wanted more
      <I>gai'shain</I>&mdash;her goal was to indenture the entire world.  She

      is tall, has pale green eyes, and hair like spun gold.  She would be
      beautiful except for the strong hint of avarice around her plump mouth.
      Little about her seemed Aiel beyond her eyes, skin, and hair.  She also
      wore rings on every finger, and non-Aiel-made jewelry everwhere else.
      All of these were seized when she was captured by
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A> and his Seanchan allies.
      Her clan now stands in ruin, with no one to blame but herself.
      Sevanna is known to have been the only person to be almost refused her

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>, p. 70&mdash;Aes Sedai of

      Born in Tear to a fisherman, she was sent to the White
      Tower on the first boat to leave after she discovered she had the
      ability to channel inborn, according to Tairen law.  As a novice, she
      was good friends with <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine Damodred</A>, and was
      present at <A Href="#Gitara">Gitara Moroso</A>'s Foretelling of the
      Rebirth of the <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>.  After being raised to the
      shawl, she joined the Blue Ajah to dedicate her life to finding and
      guiding the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>, and eventually came to
      lead the Blues' network of eyes-and-ears (i.e., spies) before being
      raised to the <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>.  She was only thirty
      years old when raised to the Amyrlin Seat, making her the youngest
      Amyrlin to that point.  She was also one of the strongest Amyrlins in
      recent history, and one of the most feared among the rulers of nations.
      Her blue-eyed stare was feared by all.  When her twenty-year connection
      to the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> was discovered, she and her
      <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A>, <A Href="#Leane">Leane
      Sharif</A>, were deposed and stilled by a group of sisters loyal to
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida a'Roihan</A>.  Siuan hoped to regain some of
      her previous standing in the new Tower that separated from
      Elaida&mdash;her knowledge of the Blue Ajah spy network is hard to
      match, and she knows much that she thought would be of use.  In one of
      her viewings, <A Href="#Min">Min</A> saw that Siuan would have to remain
      close to <A Href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</A>&mdash;if she did not, both
      of them would die.  Siuan did not initially know what she meant, but now
      realizes that she is growing to love the gray-haired man who leads the
      rebel army.  She had a Warder named <A Href="#Alric">Alric</A>, but he
      was murdered by Elaida when Siuan was deposed.  After coming to Salidar,
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> discovered how to restore Siuan's ability
      to channel, at least partially.  This resurrected a part of her bond
      with Alric, but did not bring back her former strength, or her binding
      by the Oath Rod.  She can now lie as well as any child.  She served
      as an advisor of sorts to the new Amyrlin in Salidar,
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A>, but though she put on a
      fa&ccedil;ade of hating the work, she is actually one of Egwene's
      foremost agents.  The fact that she is Aes Sedai, not to mention one who
      was stilled and Healed again, makes other sisters tend to be oblivious
      to this fact.  She was pushed very hard by Elaida as a novice.
      With Egwene being held prisoner in the Tower, Siuan has been charged
      with keeping the factions among the rebels&mdash;headed by
      <A Href="#Romanda">Romanda Cassin</A> and <A Href="#Lelaine">Lelaine

      He was one of two Warders who was with the eleven Aes Sedai that escaped
      Dumai's Wells, though Sleete barely escaped with his skin.
      His story could have been drawn from legends:  he had lain wounded for
      hours before managing to pull himself into the saddle by the reins;
      the horse carried him, nearly unconscious, for hours before arriving
      at a village, where the villagers had been tempted to sell him to a
      group of bandits.  The mayor's daughter argued for his life,
      convincing everyone that only Darkfriends would seek wounded Warders.
      The villagers hid him, and the girl nursed him to health.
      He was forced to leave in secret, as the girl had taken a liking to
      him, but in return he hunted down the bandits and killed them so they
      would never trouble the village again.
      Hattori told him she would not take a second Warder unless Sleete
      believed the person to be worthy.
      He is one of the only Warders to have ever bettered
      <A Href="#Lan">Lan Mandragoran</A>, back when Lan still practiced with

      He convinced Aram that Perrin's yellow eyes were a result of him being
      Shadowspawn, which convinced Aram to attempt to kill Perrin.

      until her recent death.
      Her kingdom was small, and she only ruled a portion of it; the rest was
      governed by nobles who were not necessarily loyal to her.  She was the
      second from her House to sit on the throne&mdash;this was the maximum
      traditionally, and the only House to hold it for four generations fell
      so fast from power that it could not recover.  She was advised by
      <A Href="#Merilille">Merilille Ceandevin</A> of the Gray Ajah.  She was
      a widow, and did not plan to marry again.  She took an interest in
      <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A>, and contrary to Mat's usual tactic of
      chasing women, <I>she</I> chased and caught <I>him</I>.  The
      two were lovers for some time.  When the Seanchan invaded her nation,
      she cooperated with them out of necessity&mdash;they let her keep her
      position of authority, but she was a puppet of the Crystal Throne.
      When the Sea Folk fought the Seanchan, destroying much of Ebou Dar in
      the process, Tylin suggested Mat use the opportunity to escape the city,
      and tie her up under the bed to make it look like he had to restrain
      her to escape.  While she was bound and gagged under the bed, the
      <I>gholam</I> came, presumably to kill Mat, and she fell easy prey to
      it.  She was found by <A Href="#Suroth">Suroth</A>'s people the next

      though she knew she could trust no one.
      <!-- Known to virtually no one until an hour before her death, Verin was

      save her own skin; once inducted, she carefully but persistently studied
      the Black Ajah&mdash;how it is organized, what its rules are, and, most
      importantly, who its members are.  She found Tomas, who was a Darkfriend
      seeking a way out, and he agreed to become her Warder.
      She wrote down all of her notes in a dense tome that she gave to Egwene
      al'Vere after drinking poison.  The poison would kill her in one hour,
      which released her from her oath:  &ldquo;I swear not to betray the
