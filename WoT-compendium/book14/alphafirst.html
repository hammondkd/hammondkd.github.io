<ul>
  <li><i><a class="name" name="Aan">Aan&rsquo;allein</a></i>,
      p. 523&mdash;Aiel
      name for <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>.  It means &ldquo;One Man,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;The Man Alone,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Man Who is an Entire
      People&rdquo; in the Old Tongue.  Lan&rsquo;s story is well-known and
      well-respected among the Aiel.  The Man Alone is no longer alone.
      <i>See</i>
      <a href="#Lan">Mandragoran, Lan</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Yulan">Abaldar Yulan</a>,
      p. 434&mdash;Former Captain of the Air and pilot of a Seanchan <i>raken</i>
      for the Forerunners.  He is small and dark.  He has since been promoted
      to Lieutenant-General, and is a member of the Low Blood.  He wears a
      black wig to hide his bald pate.  Yulan led the raid on the White Tower
      himself, for which he was promoted.
  <li><a class="name" name="Abell">Abell Cauthon</a>,
      p. 232&mdash;<a href="#Mat">Mat</a>&rsquo;s father.  He and his wife
      Natti lived in Emond&rsquo;s Field with their two unmarried
      daughters Eldrin and Bodewhin until Abell left
      with <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a>.
      They have two other daughters.  Abell is excellent
      with a bow and arrow, and is in general a really nice guy; Mat does not
      know of anyone that dislikes him.  His remaining children are about the
      age where they start to leave home&mdash;twenty, seventeen, and sixteen
      for Mat, Bode, and Eldrin, respectively.  He is one of the best judges
      of horses around, and passed some of his knowledge on to his son.
      He serves as a subcommander under <a href="#Bashere">Bashere</a> in the battle for
      Andor and Cairhien.  Mat thinks there is no one who is as honest as
      he.
      <i>See also</i>
      <a href="#Mat">Cauthon, Matrim</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Abors">Abors</a>,
      p. 234&mdash;One of <a href="#Taim">Taim</a>&rsquo;s cronies, and part of the team of
      Asha&rsquo;man and Aes Sedai who are trying to Turn <a href="#Logain">Logain</a>,
      <a href="#Toveine">Toveine</a>, <a href="#Gabrelle">Gabrelle</a>, <a href="#Androl">Androl</a>, and
      <a href="#Pevara">Pevara</a>.  He has thick eyebrows.  He was one of the
      Asha&rsquo;man who went over to the Shadow of his own volition.
  <li><a class="name" name="Adelorna">Adelorna Bastine</a>,
      p. 242&mdash;Short, slim, regal, Saldaean Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah.
      She is the Captain-General of the Green Ajah, the Ajah&rsquo;s leader.
      She was once birched by <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a>.
      She chose Rina for the Hall without a nominations
      process, which goes against Green custom.  She has three Warders;
      one died in the Seanchan attack, and Talric was wounded.
      She is of a height with <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>, with tilted eyes and dark
      hair.
  <li><a class="name" name="Adora2">Lady Adora</a>,
      p. 679&mdash;<a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a>&rsquo;s granddaughter and the Mayor of Emond&rsquo;s
      Field during <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>&rsquo;s vision of the possible future created
      during his battle with the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>.  Adora is named
      after her great aunt, Adora Aybara, who was about
      four years younger than Perrin and died when <a href="#Fain">Fain</a> killed
      Perrin&rsquo;s family.  She clearly has some Saldaean heritage, but also
      bears the dark curls that give her a distinct Two Rivers appearance.
      <i>See also</i>
      <a href="#Faile">t'Aybara, Faile ni Bashere</a>;
      <a href="#Perrin">Aybara, Perrin t&rsquo;Bashere</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Agelmar">Agelmar Jagad</a>,
      p. 187&mdash;<a href="#Easar">Easar</a>&rsquo;s general in Shienar.  He is
      possibly the best military commander alive (excepting possibly
      <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>, the Aiel chiefs, and a few Seanchan commanders).  He is
      one of the Great Captains, those assigned to lead the forces of the Light
      in the Last Battle.
  <li><a class="name" name="Aginor">Aginor</a>,
      p. 93&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  During the Age of Legends, he was one of the foremost
      biologists of his time, specializing in genetics.  He went over to the
      Shadow because only there could he do all of the experiments he wanted
      to.  He was the one who created the Trollocs, Dragkhar, <i>gholam</i>,
      Darkhounds, and other Shadowspawn.  Some of the other Forsaken think he
      was insane, for only someone insane would create some of the creatures
      he did.  He was the second one to be released from the sealing on the
      Bore, after Balthamel.  He was trapped close to
      the surface of the Bore, so he was not shielded from the passing of time
      very effectively; he emerged as a very old man, so old that his face was
      wrinkled so that one could barely make out his features anymore.  He was
      killed by <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> at the Eye of the World.  Unbeknownst
      to almost everyone (including the Forsaken), Aginor was reincarnated in
      the body of a Borderlander man and given the new name
      Osan&rsquo;gar.  Osan&rsquo;gar masqueraded as
      Corlan Dashiva, one of the Asha&rsquo;man, until he was
      killed at the cleansing of <i>saidin</i> by
      Elza Penfell and her circle.
      One of Aginor&rsquo;s creations was the
      <i>zomara</i>, androgynous not-quite-human servants; they are almost
      useless for any other task.  Aran&rsquo;gar described
      them as one of Aginor&rsquo;s &ldquo;less inspired creations.&rdquo;
      The only Shadowspawn that Aginor created which could pass through a
      Traveling gateway were <i>gholam</i>; he was smart enough to only make a
      few of them.
  <li><a class="name" name="alMoor">Master al&rsquo;Moor</a>,
      p. 855&mdash;When Perrin, as a youth, broke the blade for his scythe,
      <a href="#Luhhan">Master Luhhan</a> referred to Perrin as,
      &ldquo;that worthless of apprentice of mine.&rdquo;
  <li><a class="name" name="alThone">Widow al&rsquo;Thone</a>,
      p. 277&mdash;An old woman from the Two Rivers.  <a href="#Tam">Tam</a> suggested
      sending <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a> to her to carry water for a week to rid him
      of the notion of making Tam a nobleman.
  <li><a class="name" name="Harnesh">Alaabar Harnesh</a>,
      p. 648&mdash;A Child of the Light.  His shadowed head is missing its left
      ear.  He stood with Asunawa.  He is bald, and grew up in
      Murandy.  Many things try his patience, in <a href="#Galad">Galad</a>&rsquo;s
      estimation.  He takes command should Galad fall; he is one of Galad&rsquo;s
      best soldiers.
  <li><a class="name" name="Alanna">Alanna Mosvani</a>,
      p. 119&mdash;Aes Sedai
      of the Green Ajah.  She is dark and slender with black hair and dark
      eyes.  She has two surviving Warders, <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> (whom she
      bonded against his will) and Ihvon; her other,
      Owein, died in the Two Rivers while scouting the
      Whitecloak camp.  She later found that bonding Rand was a grievious
      error; not only is it impossible to Compel him in comparison to most
      Warders (she compared it to attempting to uproot an oak tree with her
      bare hands), but she constantly feels the pain he experiences from the
      wound in his side, perhaps even more severely than he feels it.  She
      vanished from Tear mysteriously, leaving no Travelling residues
      behind.  Rand only knows that she is north of Merrilor&mdash;far to the
      north.
      <i>See also</i>
      <a href="#Rand">al&rsquo;Thor, Rand</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Aldin">Aldin</a>,
      p. 762&mdash;Tall, young,
      Amadician former <i>gai&rsquo;shain</i>, now <a href="#Faile">Faile</a>&rsquo;s bookkeeper.
      He has square shoulders, and looks more a soldier than the bookkeeper he
      is.  He took a liking to <a href="#Arrela">Arrela</a>, and wanted to marry her,
      though she does not actually like men in that way.  He seems to have
      shifted his attentions to <a href="#Aravine">Aravine</a>.  When Aravine dies, she
      begs Faile not to tell Aldin that she was a Darkfriend.
      <i>See also</i>

      <a href="#Arrela">Shiego, Arrela</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Aledrin">Aledrin</a>,
      p. 396&mdash;Sitter for the
      White Ajah in the new Hall.  She has dark, golden hair and big, pale
      brown eyes.  She grew up in Tarabon.  She is taller than most men, and
      plump.  She was part of the Tower&rsquo;s &ldquo;embassy&rdquo; to the Black
      Tower.
  <li><a class="name" name="Algarin">Algarin Pendaloan</a>,
      p. 58&mdash;Lesser Lord of the Land in Tear.  He had a wrinkly face and a
      white beard.  He provided accomodations for <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>,
      <a href="#Min">Min</a>, Verin,
      <a href="#Cadsuane">Cadsuane</a>, <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>,
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>, and the rest of their group on his manor
      so they could recuperate from the events at Shadar Logoth.  His younger
      brother Emarin could channel, and Algarin wanted to
      be tested for the ability as well; he is now one of the Dedicated in the
      Black Tower, using his younger brother&rsquo;s name to conceal his
      identity.  <a href="#Androl">Androl</a> figured it out.

  <li><a class="name" name="Alhanra">Alhanra</a>,
      p. 706&mdash;A Child of the Light, and one of <a href="#Galad">Galad</a>&rsquo;s
      scouts.  He is described as &ldquo;spindly.&rdquo;
  <li><a class="name" name="Alivia">Alivia</a>,
      p. 356&mdash;Seanchan
      <i>damane</i> captured by Asha&rsquo;man.  She was afraid of freedom because
      she feared being captured again.  She has been collared since she was
      thirteen or fourteen, and has been <i>damane</i> for over four hundred
      years.  She is considerably stronger in the One Power than
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>, and a little bit taller.  She has fine
      lines at the corners of her sharp blue eyes and white streaks in her
      blonde hair.  <a href="#Min">Min</a> dislikes her, though not because of
      jealousy&mdash;Min had a viewing of her indicating that she will help
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> to die.  She has a very intense personality.
  <li><a class="name" name="Alix">Alix</a>,
      p. 647&mdash;A Warder who now fights with <a href="#Galad">Galad</a> and the Children
      of the Light.  His Aes Sedai has been killed.
  <li><a class="name" name="Alliandre">Alliandre Maritha Kigarin</a>,
      p. 153&mdash;Blessed of the Light, Queen of Ghealdan, Defender of Garen&rsquo;s
      Wall.  She is the fourth person to sit on the throne of Ghealdan in the
      past several months.  She wore jewelry to her meetings with
      <a href="#Masema">Masema</a> for the sole purpose of giving it to him
      such that he would not ask for anything more; she also sent a letter
      to <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> offering him her friendship and asking for
      his help.  She was subsequently captured by the Shaido Aiel, and is now
      one of <a href="#Faile">Faile</a>&rsquo;s followers.  She escaped during the battle
      between <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a> (assisted by the Seanchan) and the Shaido.
      She seems to think herself more politically adept than she actually
      is.  She has hair like the Sun.
      <i>See also</i>
      <a href="#Masema">Dagar, Masema</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Allin">Allin</a>,
      p. 626&mdash;Dark-haired Andoran.  He wears a half-beard, shaved at the
      sides.
  <li><a class="name" name="Alsalam">Alsalam Saeed Almadar</a>,
      p. 157&mdash;King of Arad
      Doman.  He had been a good ruler for over twenty years, though the
      Council had recently smuggled him out of Bandar Eban&mdash;after leaving
      the city, he seemed to have taken on the notion that he was the Rebirth
      of <a href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a>.
      He was believed to either be dead or one of
      <a href="#Graendal">Graendal</a>&rsquo;s playthings, though he has since turned up very
      much alive and in control of his own mind.  <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a> also
      tried to capture him and keep him under White Tower control.  He has
      since joined the nations at the Field of Merrilor, much to the surprise
      of <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> and the Aes Sedai (who presumed him dead).
  <li><a class="name" name="Aludra">Aludra</a>,
      p. 41&mdash;Illuminator from
      Tarabon with dark, wavy, waist-length hair done in thin braids, large
      dark eyes, and a plump mouth.  She was involved with the fireworks
      display for King Galldrian of Cairhien that went
      awry when Trollocs came.  She was blamed for its failure, though she
      believed one of her colleagues,
      Tammuz, was to blame.  She was cast out
      of the Illuminators&rsquo; Guild, and when she refused to stop practicing the
      art of making fireworks, several men tried to kill her.  She was saved
      by <a href="#Mat">Mat</a> and <a href="#Thom">Thom</a> in a barn, and as
      a sign of gratitude she gave Mat a roll of fireworks.  She later came to
      Ebou Dar, and asked Mat to find her a bellfounder.  He was knocked out
      during the battle and thus missed the bellfounder, but Aludra escaped
      and she later traveled with Mat&rsquo;s entourage.  Since the Seanchan
      destroyed the Chapter House of the Illuminators in Tanchico,
      Aludra may be the last Illuminator alive.  She has, with Mat and
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>&rsquo;s help, made dozens of dragons, what most of
      us would call cannons.  She conscripted every
      bellfounder in Andor, Tear, and Illian to make them.  They were to form
      a critical part of the defense of Caemlyn, and the Last Battle.
  <li><a class="name" name="Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</a>,
      p. 700&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the White Ajah, but secretly the head of the Black Ajah.  She
      was chosen to head the Black Ajah after the previous leader was killed
      by <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a> after she managed to kill off the
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a> without Ishamael&rsquo;s approval.
      Typical of most Whites, she has a very cool, collected personality.
      She served as <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a> under
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a>, despite being of a different Ajah than
      Elaida was raised from.  Elaida was all but forced to choose Alviarin in
      order to gain the support of the White Ajah when bringing charges
      against <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a>; unknown to Elaida, this also brought
      her the support of the Black Ajah.  Without Alviarin as Keeper, the
      White Ajah would most likely have been divided over whether to depose
      Siuan, and only the Red would be behind Elaida, which would most likely
      have led to the stilling of Elaida and possibly even the dismantling of
      the Red Ajah.  It still may, since Elaida is rapidly losing her support
      among the sisters.  If Alviarin&rsquo;s loyalties are ever revealed, it is
      likely nothing will save either of them.
      Alviarin has been shown how to Travel by
      Mesaana, and one of her first uses of it brought
      her to Tremalking for several weeks, during which Elaida removed her as
      Keeper.  She appeared to know that the Aes Sedai sent back from Salidar
      were spies; she refused to let Elaida speak with
      Meidani, who was one of them.  She has since been
      estranged from the White Ajah; her fellow Whites blamed her for
      destroying their connection to the Amyrlin, and humiliating herself and
      her Ajah in the process.  She was sent to
      <a href="#Silviana">Silviana</a> for daily beatings.
      Despite her failures, Shaidar Haran has
      promised her that she is still his praised servant;
      he marked her for his own with an invisible mark on her forehead that
      only Alviarin can sense.
      She was among those identified as Black by Verin; she fled
      the Tower some time ago, and her whereabouts are unknown.
      She was one of the Black sisters who attacked <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> in
      <i>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</i>.  She threw an errant fireball at her, which
      Egwene dodged by disappearing and reappearing behind Alviarin; the
      fireball killed Talva instead.  She retains her position
      as head of the Great Council of Thirteen.
      <a href="#Pevara">Pevara</a> used her identity to infiltrate the Sharan
      encampment.  She recently bonded <a href="#Nensen">Nensen</a> as her Warder.

  <li><a class="name" name="Amaresu">Amaresu</a>,
      p. 816&mdash;Heroine of
      Legend called back by the Horn of Valere.  She carries the Sword of the
      Sun.
  <li><a class="name" name="Amathera">Amathera Aelfdene Casmir Lounault</a>,
      p. 700&mdash;Former Panarch of Tarabon.  She vanished, allegedly at
      Aes Sedai hands, according to White Tower spies.  In reality, Amathera
      was being held prisoner by sisters of the Black Ajah under
      Liandrin, and was rescued by
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> and <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>.  They
      had her keep a low profile for several days so as not to be hurt by the
      mob outside the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace (since it is not all that far from
      &ldquo;The Panarch is dead!&rdquo; to &ldquo;Death to the
      Panarch!&rdquo;), then she returned to her position.  When the Seanchan
      invaded Tanchico, she refused to willingly give her country to the new
      conquerors; they captured her, and forced her to live as a servant.  She
      served as a dancer for <a href="#Suroth">High Lady Suroth</a>, the
      leader of the Seanchan pre-invasionary forces, until she was rescued by
      <a href="#Juilin">Juilin Sandar</a>, who took her along when he fled
      Ebou Dar with <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>.  She and Juilin have become an
      item since that time; he has been training her, with limited success, to
      stop flinching every time a Seanchan officer walks by.

      <a href="#Juilin">Sandar, Juilin</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Amyrlin">The Amyrlin Seat</a>,
      p. 39&mdash;The leader
      of the Aes Sedai, their equivalent of a King or Queen.  She in theory
      holds supreme power amongst the sisters, and leads the Hall of the Tower
      at its meetings.  Kings and queens of nations strong and weak will come
      if summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their entire trip
      figuring out how they will put a knife in her back while there.  The
      Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in
      her character.  The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must
      the vote to depose one.  Once chosen, the Amyrlin is said to be
      &ldquo;of all Ajahs and none&rdquo;&mdash;all previous affiliations with
      Ajah are ignored (at least in theory).  The Ajahs have gotten fairly
      equal numbers of Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions.
      No Amyrlin had been raised from the Red Ajah since
      Bonwhin Meraighdin, who
      was deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in
      <a href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a>&rsquo;s day, until
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a&rsquo;Roihan</a> was raised Amyrlin in Tar
      Valon after a coup deposed <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>;
      the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of
      Amyrlins from its Ajah&mdash;four of the last the last five Amyrlins
      (before Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah.  These two exceptions to
      the mean number of Amyrlins from one&rsquo;s Ajah have only added to the
      friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years.  The Amyrlin has
      a secretary of sorts, the
      <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>,
      who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the
      Amyrlin was raised from.  The Amyrlin Seat was held by
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>, raised from the Blue Ajah, until she
      was deposed for her involvement with events surrounding the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.  Her successor was the leader of
      the coup, <a href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a&rsquo;Roihan</a>, raised from
      the Red Ajah.  Siuan&rsquo;s deposition divided the Tower, and the faction
      opposing Elaida raised a new Amyrlin who could not be accused of
      choosing sides on the fateful day Siuan was deposed:
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al&rsquo;Vere</a>, who was outside the Tower and not
      even a full sister from the time Siuan was deposed to the time Egwene
      was Raised.  Other sisters outside the Tower, in many cases,
      did not reveal their loyalties to either Egwene or Elaida.
      Egwene was captured by forces loyal to Elaida during a partially
      successful attempt to turn the harbor chains to <i>cuendillar</i>;
      Elaida re-enlisted her as a Novice, and treated her as a disobedient,
      stubborn child.  Egwene remained defiant to the very last, trying to
      garner support from within.  Elaida stubbornly refused to acknowledge
      Egwene&rsquo;s warnings of a Seanchan attack; that very attack, when it
      occurred, claimed Elaida herself as a prisoner of the Seanchan.  After
      two tense days, filled with revelations of the Black Ajah, the aftermath
      of the Seanchan attack, and a near-invasion by Egwene&rsquo;s army, the Hall
      Selected a new Amyrlin:  Egwene al&rsquo;Vere, raised from the Accepted (no
      Ajah).

  <li><a class="name" name="Aviendha">Aviendha</a>,
      p. 210&mdash;Aiel of the
      Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel.  Formerly a Maiden of the Spear,
      she was forced to give up the spear to become a Wise One because she had
      the ability to channel inborn.  Her spears were melted down into other
      objects, which themselves could not be weapons, to be given away as
      gifts to the people she hated most&mdash;the metal from one spear is
      now used in a belt buckle for <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a>.
      She has green eyes, and is of age with Rand and <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>.
      She is more than pretty with dark reddish hair.
      Aviendha is one of the three women
      in <a href="#Min">Min</a>&rsquo;s viewing of Rand&mdash;she also saw that
      she was to fall in love with him when she went through the three rings
      in Rhuidean.  She denied her feelings for him at first, but when the
      wagons crossed the Dragonwall toward Cairhien, sweat tents became
      unavailable and she tried bathing as &ldquo;wetlanders&rdquo; did; Rand
      came in as she was standing before the bath in her skin, and she
      panicked.  She created a Traveling gateway to southern Seanchan (she
      does not remember how), trying to get as far away from Rand as possible,
      into the middle of winter.  When Rand rescued her, she decided she could
      not hide her feelings any longer, and the two ended up spending the
      night in each other&rsquo;s arms before coming back.  Aviendha sais a similar
      incident would not occur, and punished any Maiden who made a crack about
      it (how they found out about something that occurred on the far side of
      the world on another continent is a different subject entirely).  She
      felt <i>toh</i> toward <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> for violating her
      trust, but upon hearing that Elayne would consent to being her
      sister-wife, Aviendha felt empowered to show her feelings for Rand once
      again.  She is not certain what she thinks of a <i>second</i>
      sister-wife in Min, but she seems to accept the idea at least.  She has
      been having trouble learning Traveling again; the way Elayne forms the
      weave is different from how she used it to get to Seanchan, and it is
      difficult to learn something once you already learned it another way.
      She has, however, mastered the art of untying weaves&mdash;a feat which
      was thought impossible by all Aes Sedai, as well as the Forsaken.  She
      and Elayne have adopted each other as first-sisters.  Aviendha has a
      special ability in making wards against eavesdropping; it is unlikely
      even the Forsaken could breach one of her wards, and certainly no one
      could do so without her knowing it immediately.
      While Aviendha was staying with Elayne at the Royal Palace in Caemlyn,
      she was summoned away by the Wise Ones to complete her training.
      While in the Palace, she discovered a new Talent:  the ability to
      sense the function of a <i>ter&rsquo;angreal</i> simply by holding it in her
      hands.  Aviendha was very frustrated by the Wise Ones&rsquo; treatment of her
      when she returned from her stay with Elayne; they seemed to be punishing
      her for no reason she could ascertain, and continually asked her opinion
      of matters as if to test her responses.  It turned out that this was the
      last part of her training to become a Wise One:  she must tell the Wise
      Ones she is one of them, or at least demand to be treated as an equal by
      them.  They were pushing her harder and faster than they typically push
      apprentices because they had no time:  she was needed at the Last
      Battle, and they had no time to wait for her to become ready on her own.
      She later went to Rhuidean, going through the crystal columns that are
      the <i>ter&rsquo;angreal</i> of Aiel history.  She expected she knew what she
      will find there, and was not looking forward to watching what she
      perceived to be the failure of her people.  She was correct:  she knew
      what she would see.  Almost by accident, she entered the columns a
      second time, witnessing events she could only identify as being from the
      future:  the lives of her four children, an Aiel&ndash;Seanchan war,
      and the gradual destruction of the Aiel as a people.  She was horrified
      by her vision, and is determined to change <i>something</i> in it, just
      to prove to herself that the future is not pre-determined.  She knew her
      visions would be met with confusion, but not the unpleasant silence that
      has actually resulted.

      the Spear of the Black Rock sept of the Shaarad Aiel.  She has
      flame-colored hair and dark blue eyes.  She is first-sister to
      <a href="#Chiad">Chiad</a>, of the Goshien Aiel; the two had to sneak
      through the camp of the other to find the Wise Ones to become first
      sisters, since their clans were in blood feud at the time.  She later
      became one of the Maidens who accompanied <a href="#Faile">Faile</a>, a
      similar honor guard to what <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> has, although
      smaller and for different reasons.  She and Chiad were both captured by
      the Shaido along with the rest of Faile&rsquo;s company, and made
      <i>gai&rsquo;shain</i>.  She has refused Faile&rsquo;s offer of escape once her plan
      is ready; she vows to serve her year and a day, as prescribed by
      <i>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</i>, and then walk away.
      She and Chiad are now <i>gai&rsquo;shain</i> to <a href="#Gaul">Gaul</a>;
      Gaul groaned when he found that Bain was <i>gai&rsquo;shain</i> to one of the
      men he had to kill to save Chiad.  She and Chiad have been having fun at
      Gaul&rsquo;s expense in their service to him.  Gaul suspects
      <a href="#Dark">Sightblinder</a> would be a less infuriating
      <i>gai&rsquo;shain</i>.  He also thinks she would laugh all the way back to
      the Three-fold Land if she saw <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a> take two of the
      Shadowsworn Aiel captive.

      Trollocs pulled him down as he reached for his spare sword, so he
      pulled out the crossbow, hit a Trolloc in the eye with it at point-blank

      silvery and overlapping, polished to a mirror-like luster.  His Sharan
      accent is not as thick as the others&rsquo; accents, likely because his is
      an imitation.  The legend of Bao the Wyld is likely the Sharan
      equivalent of the Prophecies of the <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>, or at least an
      interpretation of their role in them.

      recognize her the next time they met.  She was right&mdash;he did.  He
      became one of Egeanin&rsquo;s <i>so&rsquo;jhin</i>.  When Egeanin captured his ship,
      he was trying to drop the male <i>a&rsquo;dam</i> in the ocean.  The two
      became involved in a romance (she purchased him so they could stay
      together), which no one else seemed to understand&mdash;anyone who talks

      He is now <a href="#Leilwin2">Leilwin</a>&rsquo;s husband and used to be

      <a href="#Mat">Mat</a> describes him as &ldquo;not to bad a guy&rdquo; except

      She was raised to the shawl about three years ago, and as

      Asha&rsquo;man as a Warder.  She is pretty, and has high cheekbones and
      slightly tilted brown eyes.  She often tries too hard to prove
      herself.  She eventually bonded <a href="#Karldin">Karldin Manfor</a> as
      her Warder.  She died shortly after he did, both of them exhuasted from

      in dresses, and those are usually quite revealing.  She has her eyes on
      many men, but <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a> foremost&mdash;she is
      <a href="#Min">Min</a>&rsquo;s hawk in her viewings of Perrin.  She has black
      hair.  She is a very capable ruler, willing to do almost anything to
      preserve the welfare and independence of her people.  She is tall,
      pretty, young, and has black hair.  Since Faile&rsquo;s captivity, she has
      backed off of Perrin, though rumors have been circulating that the she
      and Perrin slept together.  They did not, of course; Perrin was simply
      taken into her tent until he recovered from illness.  She and Faile have
      worked things out between themselves, defusing the rumors.
      Berelain is willing to do almost <i>anything</i> to ensure that Mayene
      is preserved and not merely annexed by another larger country.  She is
      one of the most skillful political maneuverers that Faile has

      a leather patch over it.  He has shoulder-length gray hair and is of

      a soft voice, sharp eyes, and black hair to his shoulders.
      He was of course a puppet of the Seanchan government while acting as
      king of Altara, but it <i>did</i> make him the
      equal of <a href="#Suroth">Suroth</a> under the law.
      He was secretly plotting a resistance to the Seanchan,
      but changed his loyalties when confronted with the choice of loyalty or
      death.  His head is now shaven, in the manner of the Blood, leaving only
      a dark strip on top.  Seven of his fingernails are lacquered, one more
      than anyone this side of the Aryth Ocean with the exception of
      <a href="#Fortuona">Fortuona</a> herself.  Beslan has not plotted against her since

  <li><a class="name" name="Birgitte">Birgitte</a>,
      p. 83&mdash;Hero of Legend, bound to the Horn of Valere until
      <a href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</a> ripped her away.  She has long blonde
      hair that she keeps in a braid, and is one of the best with bow and
      arrows in all of human history.  During <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>&rsquo;s
      struggle with Moghedien, Birgitte was ripped out of
      <i>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</i> and almost died.  She would have if she had not
      been saved by <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>, who bonded her as a Warder
      to give her the strength and quick healing she needed to survive.  She
      is always linked to <a href="#Gaidal">Gaidal Cain</a> in the stories,
      and misses him immensely since he was spun out normally while she was
      ripped out.  She lived four lives between the founding of the White
      Tower and the Trolloc Wars, one of which involved her and Gaidal Cain
      <i>helping</i> to found the Tower.  She is slowly forgetting the details
      of those lives, which terrifies her.  She has lived as a soldier, a
      forest woman, a general, a guard, a noble thief, a lady, a peasant, a
      killer, and a savior.  This is, however, the first time she has been a
      Warder.  She is nothing like the stories say she is supposed
      to be like, except that she <i>is</i> pretty.
      Her bond with Elayne appears to be different than most Warder bonds,
      possibly because Elayne and Birgitte are both women; they mirror each
      other&rsquo;s moods more, synchronize their cycles, and in general are linked
      more strongly to each other than most Warders to their Aes Sedai.

  <li><a class="name" name="Cadsuane">Cadsuane Melaidhrin</a>,
      p. 157&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah with iron-gray hair that she
      keeps in a bun.  She is handsome, not pretty.  She at some point retired
      to a rose garden in northern Ghealdan, but has since left it due to the
      difficulty of growing decent roses with the weather the way it used to
      be.  She refused two appointments to the Hall of the Tower, when
      refusing even once is unheard of.  She also refused to become head of
      the Green Ajah.  It is said that she has had more Warders than most
      sisters have had shoes.  She has more strength than anyone in a thousand
      years except perhaps for <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> and
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>.  Although she is a Green, she has
      confronted and captured more men that can channel than any other woman;
      unknown to most, the men she captures tend to live longer after being
      gentled than the average.  She is somewhat of a living legend among Aes
      Sedai.  According to <a href="#Min">Min</a>, Cadsuane would teach
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> and the Asha&rsquo;man something&mdash;they would not
      like it, especially not from her, but they would have to learn it.  She
      is the oldest Aes Sedai alive.  Cadsuane wears many ornaments in her
      hair, all of which are <i>ter&rsquo;angreal</i> she has collected over the
      years&mdash;<a href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</a> calls it a &ldquo;paralis net.&rdquo;
      One of them is a reservoir, or a well&mdash;it &ldquo;stores&rdquo;
      <i>saidar</i> for later use in places where one might not be able to tap
      the Source, such as inside the Guardian at Far Madding, her hometown.
      It is not known whether it works inside an Ogier <i>stedding</i>, too.
      Another vibrates in the presence of men who can
      channel; it is likely this ornament that has allowed her to capture so
      many men to be gentled.  Another resembles a weather vane, and moves to
      point in the direction that someone last touched the Source.
      There are many others, including three that she
      does not know the purpose of.  <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a> suspected
      Cadsuane may have been a Darkfriend, but based on her actions and

      Cadsuane did, reluctantly, agree to be Rand&rsquo;s advisor, provided he
      adhered to a proper level of conduct.  She is just shy of 300 years
      old.

      p. 727&mdash;<a href="#Faile">Faile</a>&rsquo;s mother.  She has raven-black hair
      winged with white, and is about a head taller than her husband
      Davram, the Marshal-General of Saldaea.  She was
      stabbed by a man while he was ransacking her tent, but she survived.
      She and Davram rarely yell, but they have a very upfront method of
      conversing with each other that often makes others somewhat
      uncomfortable.  She did not approve of her daughter&rsquo;s marriage at first,
      but was eventually convinced to accept it.  She insisted on training
      Zarine (i.e., Faile) in the ways of court intrigue and
      politics, which she hated.  However, Faile has come to realize that she
      would be lost without her mother&rsquo;s instruction.  With
      <a href="#Tenobia">Tenobia</a> dead, Deira is now Queen of Saldaea and her husband
      King, though they have refused the Crown until the battle is over,
      deferring command to <a href="#Lan">Lan</a> because of Davram&rsquo;s incident with

  <li><a class="name" name="Delarn">Delarn</a>,
      p. 613&mdash;One of the Redarms.
  <li><a class="name" name="Demandred">Demandred</a>,
      p. 66&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  He is tall and handsome, with a hawk-like nose and dark hair.
      Second-best seems to be the story of his life.
      He was born <a href="#Barid">Barid Bel Medar</a> one day after
      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, and from the first day
      proceeded to almost equal Lews Therin&rsquo;s accomplishments, almost equal
      Lews Therin&rsquo;s strength, and almost equal him but never surpass him in
      everything.  He became one of the Light&rsquo;s greatest generals, once again
      second in command under Lews Therin.  It was Demandred himself who
      re-discovered the strategy of separating foes and crushing them one at a
      time; he discovered it by reading old writings.
      Demandred believed that he was
      Lews Therin&rsquo;s intellectual and military superior, and was furious when
      Lews Therin was chosen to lead the Light&rsquo;s forces over him during the
      War of the Shadow.  He developed a burning hatred of Lews Therin, and
      finally dedicated his life to the Shadow so he could finally better Lews
      Therin&mdash;he believed the Shadow would eventually win the war, since
      Lews Therin was commanding the Light&rsquo;s armies, and that if he, Barid Bel
      Medar, had been chosen to command them, the Light would have prevailed.
      When Demandred was freed from the Bore, he transferred his hatred of
      Lews Therin intact to the new recipient of his soul,
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a>.  Demandred was told by the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> to lead his plan to convert or destroy
      Rand, and promised him to be <a href="#Naeblis">Nae&rsquo;blis</a> if he
      succeeded.  However, since <a href="#Moridin">Moridin</a> has been
      declared Nae&rsquo;blis, he is now only ordered to obey Moridin.  Demandred&rsquo;s
      assumed identity and whereabouts are unknown,
      but he had formed an alliance of sorts with
      Mesaana and <a href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</a> before their respective
      demises.  Demandred never smiles,
      and never seems to enjoy anything; <a href="#Graendal">Graendal</a> once heard him
      say that he would laugh the day he could snap the neck of Lews Therin.
      According to Lannis, a Blue Ajah scholar, Demandred is the
      only Forsaken who exceeded Mesaana in anger.
      The Great Lord has stated, through Moridin, that he is pleased with
      Demandred&rsquo;s actions.

      novice, although she only got as far as the gates once.  She has a bit
      of a foul tongue.  She managed to get Atuan

      seized the reins herself.  She has blue eyes and wears a sapphire on her
      forehead in the Cairhienin style.  She and Seaine were charged with
      determining whether it was possible to fool or circumvent the Oath Rod;
      they discovered an alteration to the Mask of Mirrors that would allow
      the user to distort the <i>words</i> they were saying, so that they
      could in fact say anything at all (with approximately the same length
      sentences, at least) and have everyone else hear something else.  She
      retains her position as a Sitter now that Tower has reunited.
  <li><a class="name" name="Mellar">Doilin Mellar</a>,
      p. 205&mdash;Caemlyn Palace Guard who at one point
      slew <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>&rsquo;s assassins.  He cut the first&rsquo;s head
      off, <i>threw</i> his sword at the second and speared him with it, and
      took the poisoned dagger from the third and killed him with it.  He is
      wiry, has a sharp face, and is coldhearted, though he smiles a lot.  He
      is fond of teasing women.  He claimed to have been a merchant&rsquo;s guard,
      then a mercenary, then a Hunter for the Horn.  He later became
      a lieutenant in the Queen&rsquo;s Guards, and in gratitude, Elayne made him
      the captain of her bodyguard.
      He has dark eyes a narrow face that is not pretty or handsome.
      He moves with a swordsman&rsquo;s grace, and is very strong.
      Mellar claimed to be from Andor, near Baerlon, and he claimed to have
      fought on <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a>&rsquo;s side during the Succession.
      Half the palace, and a significant number of troops in the Andoran army,
      accepted the rumor that he is the father of Elayne&rsquo;s twins, which she
      allowed to continue to protect their true father&rsquo;s identity.
      Unbeknownst to Elayne or practically anyone else until it was too late,
      he also answers to the name <a href="#Hanlon">Daved Hanlon</a>,
      a Darkfriend.  To Mellar, a name
      is akin to a coat&mdash;to be changed regularly and to suit the
      conditions.  Elayne grew more than suspicious of his loyalties, and
      eventually had Hark follow him to see who he was meeting.
      It was the Black sisters; Elayne arrested him immediately.  In the
      subsequent fight with Elayne, he killed Eldrith and
      Temaile rather than let them slow him down.  He escaped with
      one of Elayne&rsquo;s copies of <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>&rsquo;s foxhead medallion.

  <li><a class="name" name="Egwene">Egwene al&rsquo;Vere</a>,
      p. 82&mdash;Young
      woman from Emond&rsquo;s Field and daughter of the innkeeper there,
      now raised to the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>.  She
      has considerable strength with the One Power, and is
      one of the strongest Aes Sedai in over a thousand years.  She is also
      the first Dreamer in the Tower in almost 500 years; she trained with the
      Wise Ones to learn more of this Talent.
      Before her time with the Wise Ones, she was sold by
      Liandrin to <a href="#Suroth">Suroth</a> to be made <i>damane</i>.
      She was held captive under the name <a href="#Tuli">Tuli</a>
      under care of the <i>sul&rsquo;dam</i> <a href="#Renna">Renna Emain</a>.
      When Egwene escaped, she left Renna with her <i>a&rsquo;dam</i> around
      Renna&rsquo;s neck; the fact that Renna and another <i>sul&rsquo;dam</i>,
      Seta, who was similarly captured when Egwene escaped,
      were bound by the <i>a&rsquo;dam</i> threatens to destroy the foundation of
      Seanchan society, especially their enslavement of women who can
      channel.  Egwene is good friends with
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</a>, the
      <a href="#DH">Daughter-Heir of Andor</a>, and is
      also a childhood friend of <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a>, the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.  In fact, Rand and Egwene were all
      but Promised in their youth, but both of them feel an almost
      sibling-like love for each other now; they knew that they could not get
      married, and did not want to.  Egwene was at one point the love object
      of both of Elayne&rsquo;s brothers, <a href="#Galad">Galad</a> and
      <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>&mdash;she was flattered by Galad&rsquo;s attentions,
      but she did not return them. She did find Gawyn to her liking, and had
      a dream of bonding him as her Warder; she did so to prevent him from
      dying due to injuries suffered while protecting her from Seanchan
      assassins, and married him once he had recovered in a small ceremony
      conducted by her <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>,
      <a href="#Silviana">Silviana Brehon</a>.
      Egwene was most likely chosen Amyrlin because she was in the Aiel Waste
      when the rebellion occurred, and because the Aes Sedai thought she could
      be manipulated by them without too much trouble; if this was their
      intent, they made a grave mistake, for Egwene promises to be one of the
      strongest Amyrlins in history.
      Egwene enlisted <a href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</a>
      as the commander of her army to invade Tar Valon and remove
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a> from power.  The invasion proved to be
      unnecessary&mdash;Elaida was captured, and the Hall chose her to replace
      her just before the invasion began.
      Egwene has opened the novice books to all
      interested women for the first time in history&mdash;in the past, they
      were only open to girls of a certain age, for fear that older women
      would not be able to handle the discipline.  This policy has increased
      the Tower&rsquo;s population to levels unseen since
      <a href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a>&rsquo;s time.
      Egwene has also discovered many lost Talents
      of the Age of Legends, such as Dreaming, Traveling, and the making of
      <i>cuendillar</i>.  She was guided to Dreaming by the Wise Ones, with
      whom she studied in the Aiel Waste, and was guided to the making of
      <i>cuendillar</i> by <a href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</a> while she was
      captured, but Traveling was her discovery alone&mdash;she worked it out
      herself based on her familiarity with <i>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</i>.
      She has recovered some other abilities through Moghedien as well.
      Prior to the reunification of the Tower,
      Egwene was captured by sisters loyal to Elaida after executing her plan
      to block the harbor by turning the harbor chain to <i>cuendillar</i>.
      She was held prisoner in the Tower, and re-enlisted as a Novice
      again.  She accepted all punishments Elaida and others imposed upon her
      for insisting that she was still the Amyrlin Seat and still Aes Sedai.
      Her strong will and persistence earned her the respect of nearly
      all the novices, several of the Accepted, and more than a few Aes Sedai
      as well.
      Egwene&rsquo;s plans to subvert Elaida from the inside by making suggestions
      and hinting that various things Elaida has done are indefinsible helped
      convince even more sisters, including <a href="#Silviana">Silviana</a>, to
      support her.
      Egwene tried very hard to convince the Hall&mdash;both the
      Hall in Tar Valon and the Hall in Exile&mdash;that they must be prepared
      for the Seanchan attack she knew was imminent.  When it came anyway,
      she fought harder than perhaps anyone believed possible, doing almost as
      much damage to the Seanchan as they did to the Tower&rsquo;s inhabitants.
      Egwene was rescued from the Tower shortly after the raid by
      Gawyn, Bryne, and <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a>&mdash;she was quite angry at Siuan
      and Gawyn for disobeying her orders to leave her be.  Gawyn had to save
      her life to crawl back into her good graces.  She would probably refuse
      to acknowledge it, but she is almost as stubborn as
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>.  Egwene has grave concerns about Rand&rsquo;s plans to
      break the Seals on the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>&rsquo;s prison.

      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a> in Tar Valon.  She was born the
      youngest daughter of a minor House in the north of Murandy.  She
      occasionally has the Foretelling, and as a result of a Foretelling she
      had concerning the importance of the Royal Family of Andor in Tarmon
      Gaidon, she served as advisor to <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a> of
      Andor for her entire reign.  She later led the coup that deposed
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> and placed herself on the Amyrlin Seat
      in Siuan&rsquo;s place.  She distrusts anyone not of the Red Ajah (as
      most Reds do), and does not think she will ever be able to trust any
      member of the Blue Ajah again.
      Her <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a> was
      <a href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</a> of the White Ajah&mdash;she
      was all but forced to choose Alviarin due to her role in the deposition
      of Siuan.  If she had chosen a Keeper from her Ajah, she most likely
      would not have won the support of the White Ajah, and then <i>she</i>
      would have been stilled and exiled from the Tower instead of Siuan.
      She eventually removed Alviarin and raised
      <a href="#Tarna">Tarna Feir</a> in her place after Alviarin vanished for
      some months.
      Her Foretelling about the importance of Andor&rsquo;s royal family
      during the Last Battle occurred around the time the Succession was going
      on, so she immediately attached herself to Morgase as soon as it became
      clear that she would be the one to take the Lion Throne.  Another of her
      Foretellings was to predict that <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a>
      would shake the world on its very foundations&mdash;she constantly kicks
      herself for not doing something about him when he was right in front
      of her, little more than a farmboy at the time.
      Her most recent Foretelling was that &ldquo;the White Tower would be
      whole again, except for remnants cast out and scorned,
      whole and stronger than ever.
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a> will face the Amyrlin Seat and know her
      anger.  The Black Tower will be rent in blood and fire, and sisters will
      walk its grounds.&rdquo;  The Foretelling about Rand is obviously deadly
      accurate.  However, the one about the Royal Family occurred at an
      inopportune time: at the time of Elaida&rsquo;s Foretelling, the Royal
      Family was not certain.  It may have meant Morgase,
      <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>, <a href="#Galad">Galad</a>, and
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> (they have all had a large role to play in
      the recent past), but it is also possible it could have meant the old
      Royal Family, that of <a href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</a>,
      <a href="#Taringail">Taringail</a>, Galad, and later Elayne and Gawyn as
      well.  After all, Morgase is just Morgase, but Tigraine is the mother of
      the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.  Her most recent Foretelling
      was of course be fulfilled, but not necessarily how she had interpreted
      it; she did not realize that the Amyrlin Seat in the Foretelling might
      not be herself, that the remnants cast out might be those loyal to her,
      and that the destruction of the Black Tower might have nothing to do
      with her.
      Elaida is quite strong in the One Power; only Siuan (before she was
      stilled and Healed), <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> (before being drained by the
      Eelfinn),
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>, <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>,
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>, and a few others could match her
      strength.  Elaida has always sought positions of power; she chose to
      follow Morgase to have a better chance at guiding the forces in the Last
      Battle, and tried to capture Rand al&rsquo;Thor in an effort to gain
      similar control.  The only sisters that supported her were those that
      were actually Black Ajah and those that would follow any Amyrlin legally
      raised, as Elaida was (although just barely: all laws used to raise her
      were stretched almost to their breaking point, and some believe they
      actually <i>did</i> shatter).  Elaida started to build a palace for
      herself atop the Warders&rsquo; old practice yard.  The building was to
      be about as tall as the White Tower.
      She had no plans to be merciful to those who
      rebelled against her when she deposed Siuan&mdash;her terms were that
      the Blue Ajah no longer existed, and that any sister who followed
      Egwene must serve penance under her personal guidance before being
      readmitted to the Tower.  Elaida replaced Alviarin as Keeper with a
      sister of the Red Ajah, <a href="#Tarna">Tarna Feir</a>,
      and she had suspicions that Alviarin was trying to commit treason
      against the Tower.
      She ordered <a href="#Seaine">Seaine Herimon</a> to &ldquo;follow the
      trail of treason&rdquo; as far as it went, even to the Keeper herself.
      Seaine interpreted this as a charge to capture members of the Black
      Ajah, leading to a grave situation for Seaine, as she had uncovered
      several Black sisters and no longer felt she could trust Elaida.  Elaida
      continually ignored Egwene&rsquo;s warnings about a Seanchan
      attack; when the attack came, Elaida was woefully unprepared, and a
      significant fraction of the Tower was captured and made <i>damane</i>,
      including herself.  She is currently held captive as a <i>damane</i>
      named Suffa.  She knows the weave for Traveling, and either
      she shared this knowledge (perhaps under duress) with the Seanchan or
      they discovered it by observing other Aes Sedai.

      p. 16&mdash;Former <a href="#DH">Daughter-Heir of Andor</a>,
      now Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah and Queen of Andor.  She
      is the daughter of <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a> and her late husband,
      <a href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</a>, and sister to
      <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>.  She is also half-sister to
      <a href="#Galad">Galad</a>, although she would rather not be reminded of
      this fact; she thinks Galad virtuous to the point of fault, and does not
      really like him.  She has considerable strength in the One Power, and
      is one of the strongest female channelers in a thousand years or more,
      possibly since the Age of Legends, with the exceptions of
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>, <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>, Sharina,
      <a href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</a>, and some trainees.  She has
      red-gold curly hair.  During her stay in the Stone of Tear, Elayne
      realized she loved <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a>, and told him how
      she felt; he felt similarly.  She had no idea at the time what
      <a href="#Min">Min</a> meant about &ldquo;having to share him,&rdquo;
      but now knows about Min&rsquo;s viewing of Rand with the three women&rsquo;s heads,
      indicating that Rand will fall in love with Min, Elayne, and Aviendha,
      and they with him.  Later, when she and Nynaeve had trouble with
      <a href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</a>, Elayne ended up bonding
      <a href="#Birgitte">Birgitte</a> as her Warder (despite being only
      Accepted at the time) in order to save Birgitte&rsquo;s life.  Elayne later
      went to Ebou Dar and found the Bowl of the Winds, a <i>ter&rsquo;angreal</i>
      that they used to fix the weather.  She then returned to Andor upon
      hearing news of her mother&rsquo;s disappearance; she has since taken the Lion
      Throne, fighting the Black Ajah, Darkfriends, and other Andoran nobles.
      She recently ended Arymilla&rsquo;s campaign for the
      Throne, which convinced all but one of the necessary nobles to support
      her for the Lion Throne.
      During that campaign, Elayne was captured by the Black Ajah,
      though Birgitte convinced the Windfinders to help rescue her.  She then
      convinced several other houses to support her&mdash;evidently their
      main concern was that she would be a puppet of Rand al&rsquo;Thor.  In the
      mean time, Elayne has managed to reproduce several <i>ter&rsquo;angreal</i>,
      something which no one else has been able to do since the Breaking of
      the World, as well as discover a way to share a Warder bond between
      three women; she bonded Rand along with Aviendha, her new sister by Aiel
      tradition, and Min.  Shortly after bonding Rand, she became pregnant
      with Rand&rsquo;s twins.  To protect the children, she is not revealing the
      father of the twins, and has allowed the rumor that
      <a href="#Mellar">Doilin Mellar</a> is their father to persist as an
      added means of protection.
      She is the first ruler of Andor to <i>ever</i> cede land to anyone:
      she agreed with the Sea Folk to cede a few square miles of Andor to them
      in exchange for their help feeding the city during the siege.
      She also sends Andoran troops to the Black Tower (which is on Andoran
      soil) periodically to remind its inhabitants that they are still within
      Andor and subject to its laws.  She is proving to be a capable leader,
      one her people may eventually be quite proud of, though for now times in
      Andor are hard enough that most do not appreciate her yet.

      for her rivals.  Elayne imprisoned her after Arymilla&rsquo;s failed attempt
      to take the Throne.  Her husband still holds out the hope of seizing

      p. 78&mdash;A young woman from Baerlon.  She is lithe and slight of build,
      and keeps her dark hair in short ringlets.  She has dark, deep,
      worried-looking eyes.  She has a special ability that few
      besides herself know about:  she sees images and auras around people,
      especially around Aes Sedai, Warders, and Asha&rsquo;man, that foretell their
      futures.  Min does not always know what these viewings mean, but when
      she does, the viewings <i>will</i> happen; it is only a question of how
      and when.  Min was fascinated by the number of images she saw around
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>, especially the one she saw that included
      herself:  he was destined to fall in love with three different women,
      one of which was herself.  She usually dressed in attire reserved for
      men; this habit was picked up when growing up with her father, who was a
      miner.  However, once she started to develop feelings for Rand, she
      began to wear more traditionally feminine attire&mdash;still coat and
      trousers, but cut to emphasize female characteristics.
      Min was in Tar Valon
      helping <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a> with her viewings&rsquo; information when
      Siuan was deposed, and it was Min that freed Siuan and
      <a href="#Leane">Leane</a> from the dungeon.  She accompanied the two
      former leaders of the Aes Sedai to Salidar; once there, she left for
      Caemlyn with Salidar&rsquo;s embassy to Rand.  Once in Caemlyn, she brought
      information to Rand about the embassy there, and its intentions.  She
      had only had one viewing that she thought ever failed, which concerned
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>: since Moiraine was believed dead, she
      hoped that her viewings might be wrong at least once in a while.
      All hope of this was dashed when Moiraine was rescued by
      <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>, however.  Min is
      one of only three women that can rightfully call herself a lover to the
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon Reborn</a>, and she is now bonded to Rand via a
      Warder bond that she shares with the other two,
      <a href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</a> and <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>.  She
      is fond of reading books by the late Herid Fel, a
      philosopher who worked in Rand&rsquo;s school of thought and was killed by a
      <i>gholam</i> or <a href="#Slayer">Slayer</a>,
      presumably because he had stumbled upon
      information crucial to the defeat of the Shadow.  She had a viewing of
      Elayne just before the door closed that Elayne would become pregnant
      with twins; she told half the palace before Elayne herself knew.&hellip;
      When Rand was collared briefly by <a href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</a>, she forced
      Rand to strangle Min&mdash;she nearly died until Rand siezed the True
      Power and destroyed Semirhage with balefire.  She still has nightmares
      about the incident.  Min has been studying Fel&rsquo;s books, thinking that
      they hold the key to winning the Last Battle.  She knows she cannot
      fight herself, nor contribute directly in any other way, but she vows to
      solve the mystery of how to seal the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>
      away.

      that he could talk to wolves.  He did not find any problem with the
      ability by itself, but felt the need to get away from the Red Ajah, who
      thought they should gentle him (even though there was nothing to be
      gentled) because of his ability.  Elyas helped
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a> learn that he could talk to wolves as well;
      Perrin did not necessarily like the ability, but has gotten over the

      <a href="#Deira">Deira</a> Bashere, their oldest surviving offspring.
      Her two older brothers were killed, and when Davram sent her younger
      brother off to fight while keeping her at home, she ran away and swore
      the oath of a Hunter of the Horn in Illian.  When she became a Hunter,
      she renounced her old name, Zarine, at first considering adopting the
      name &ldquo;Mandarb&rdquo;&mdash;she chose Faile when she found that
      <a href="#Mandarb">Mandarb</a> was the name of <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>&rsquo;s
      horse.  She fell in love with <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a> while

      She was shocked, but even more so to find out that
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> was the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> and
      that both he and Perrin are <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i>.  Faile stayed near Perrin,
      and finally accompanied him to the Two Rivers where she helped fend off
      the Trolloc attacks; the two were married shortly afterwards.  They were
      then proclaimed Lord and Lady of the Two Rivers.  Perrin hated the idea,
      but Faile insisted they have a modest estate, and even servants, which
      she trained herself.  Her name means &ldquo;falcon&rdquo; in the Old
      Tongue; she is the falcon in <a href="#Min">Min</a>&rsquo;s viewings of
      Perrin.  She is very protective of her blacksmith, and does whatever she
      can to make sure he not so much as <i>looks</i> at another woman, even
      though he has no intention of doing so.  She is a very jealous wife,
      especially toward people like <a href="#Berelain">Berelain</a> who eye
      her husband all the time.  She even cornered <a href="#Min">Min</a> when
      they first came to Caemlyn and Perrin greeted her warmly, to make sure
      Min had no intentions toward him.  She left with Perrin for Ghealdan to
      find <a href="#Masema">Masema</a>, and while he was away her party was
      ambushed by the Shaido Aiel and she was taken <i>gai&rsquo;shain</i> by them.
      She and the servants captured with her attempted to escape, but were
      betrayed by Galina Casban.  She was
      now a personal servant of Sevanna, and she
      seemed to be one of Sevanna&rsquo;s favorites&mdash;for both service and
      punishment.  She is a natural leader, even earning the respect
      and obedience of <a href="#Alliandre">Alliandre</a>, the Queen of
      Ghealdan, and <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a>, the former Queen of
      Andor (though she does not know Morgase&rsquo;s true identity).
      Alliandre, Morgase, and Faile were rescued by the <i>Mera&rsquo;din</i>,
      the Brotherless, Aiel men traveling with the Shaido when the left the
      Three-Fold Land.
      Their rescue coincided with Perrin&rsquo;s attack on the Shaido encampment,
      resulting in the deaths of many of the Aielmen.
      Now that she has been rescued, Faile has taken it upon herself to do
      the things her husband is unable or unwilling to do&mdash;first among
      them, killing <a href="#Masema">Masema</a>, the <a href="#Prophet">Prophet</a>.
      She has since been trying to patch things up with Berelain, attempting
      to deal with the rumors about inappropriate relations between her and

      started training for the Deathwatch Guards when he was fifteen.  He was
      cited twice for heroism, and mentioned in dispatches three times.  After
      seven years, after her birth, he was named to <a href="#Tuon">Tuon</a>&rsquo;s
      personal bodyguard, though that was not her name at the time (and using
      that name now would be an insult to her).  He was one of only three

      Gaebril was discovered to be Rahvin, one
      of the Forsaken, who has a preference to having pretty women around him.
      His &ldquo;pretty woman&rdquo; was Morgase, and he planned to wrest

      left the country so quickly a rumor sprang up that she had been killed;
      when Caemlyn was taken by <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> and Rahvin killed,
      the rumor changed to say that Rand had killed Morgase, instead of

      she speaks to him, and Aes Sedai often forsook their work to watch
      him practice (shirtless) in the sword yard when he was in training.

      accompanied <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a>&rsquo;s deposition and joined
      Eamon Valda&rsquo;s band of the Children of the Light.
      Because of his sword skill, Galad was promoted to an official position
      very quickly, and soon controlled his own small band of men.  He says he
      became a Whitecloak because it &ldquo;felt right.&rdquo;  He is
      extremely virtuous, and will do whatever he thinks is right regardless
      of who it hurts, even himself.  In fact, he started a war in Samara to
      help Elayne and Nynaeve escape.  His sign is a winged silver sword,
      point down.  Galad had feelings for <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al&rsquo;Vere</a>,
      and although she was flattered by his attentions, she did not return his
      love.  He is quite popular among his soldiers.  Galad believed
      that Valda killed his mother after sexually abusing her, and killed him
      as punishment for this.  He was incorrect about the killing part, at
      least.  Galad has much skill with the sword,
      and has officially achieved Blademaster status by killing Valda,
      by many accounts one of the greatest swordsmen in the world.
      Galad is also a better swordsman than his brother, Gawyn, who also
      achieved Blademaster status by killing <a href="#Hammar">Hammar</a> and
      Coulin, their teachers in the Tower.
      Galad became Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light after
      he killed Eamon Valda, coming to lead the 7000 or so men that remain
      part of the Children under the Lord Captain Commander; the rest
      separated to follow Rhadam Asunawa,
      the High Inquisitor.

      <a href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</a>.  He moved to his private estates in

      Salidar persuaded him to command the army they would need to take the

      when she publicly shamed him years ago, so it took some time for their
      relationship to develop.  He planned to be the
      first general to take the city of Tar Valon&mdash;the closest anyone
      else had ever come was with Guaire Amalasan&rsquo;s
      armies, who got as far as the White Tower itself, and
      <a href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a>,
      who never managed to go beyond beseiging the city.
      Actually, Amalasan&rsquo;s troops never beseiged the city, they simply managed
      to breech the walls; Hawkwing never managed to stop the supply ships

      may indeed have succeeded, with the help of the Seanchan raid, but it
      eventually proved unnecessary:  the Tower surrendered, selected Egwene
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin</a>, and stood down.  He resisted being put in charge
      of the Tower Guard, leaving <a href="#Chubain">Chubain</a> in place at that post.
      He is stocky, with a bluff face.
      The years have given him some sort of comforting calmness.
      Men always follow him&mdash;they have learned from history
      that doing so is the path to military victory.  Bryne taught
      <a href="#Galad">Galad</a> and <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a> to practice
      the sword with both hands alternating to avoid weakness.

      and Gaul now walks at Perrin&rsquo;s side during battle and elsewhere.
      He tells Perrin that he followed him initially because Perrin saved his

      Perrin to be an honorable leader).
      Gaul wants to marry <a href="#Chiad">Chiad</a>, but though she would agree to

      Shaido captured her, Gaul became truly dedicated to
      recapturing her and bringing her back to him.
      He killed at least a dozen Aiel warriors to get to Chiad;
      he was somewhat disappointed to learn that <a href="#Bain">Bain</a> was
      <i>gai&rsquo;shain</i> to one of them as well.
      Gaul has said he would consider accepting Bain as a wife just to get
      Chiad&rsquo;s bridal wreath, though he is not excited about the prospect.
      Since both Chiad <i>and</i> Bain are now <i>gai&rsquo;shain</i> to Gaul for
      many months more, they have been using every opportunity to tease Gaul,
      from washing his undergarments to sharpening spears for him.

  <li><a class="name" name="Gawyn">Gawyn Trakand</a>,
      p. 82&mdash;Son of

      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>.  He is, technically, First Prince of the Sword
      now that Elayne is Queen.  He and his half-brother
      <a href="#Galad">Galad</a> went to train with the Warders in the White
      Tower, as all sons of Andoran queens have for centuries, and both now
      possess considerable skill with the sword.  During the chaos that
      erupted after <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>&rsquo;s deposition, Gawyn
      formed a band of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders
      except Galad, who are called the Younglings.  The Younglings fought back
      against their teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and
      <a href="#Leane">Leane</a> from their imprisonment.  Gawyn himself
      killed <a href="#Hammar">Hammar</a> and Coulin,
      the men in charge of teaching the sword and
      for his personal training, respectively, both of which were
      Blademasters&mdash;few Warders are as good as they were, and Gawyn
      managed to kill both of them.  When he learned more of what actually
      happened, Gawyn did not know which party to support&mdash;he believed
      that anyone who opposed Tower Law by trying to free Siuan and Leane was
      wrong, but at the same time he realized he did not know all the facts
      surrounding the change in leadership.  In fact, his sister Elayne and
      her friends <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara</a> and
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al&rsquo;Vere</a> sided with those
      who broke from the Tower, and Egwene, the woman he wanted to marry, was
      their leader.  He believed the rumor that <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>
      killed his mother, and only refrained from killing him because Egwene
      made him promise not to; it is not known whether he knows that
      Morgase still lives.  Gawyn made many enemies inside and outside
      the Tower, just by leading the Younglings.  He detested Rand because he
      thinks Rand killed his mother (when in fact no one did), and was very
      upset when he found out that his sister loved him.
      He has since forgiven Rand, however, upon digesting evidence from the
      Aes Sedai and other sources.
      Gawyn led the Younglings on harrying parties against the
      army besieging Tar Valon; <a href="#Bryne">Lord Bryne</a> was quite upset
      to find out that it was someone who had inside information about his
      tactics that was harrying him so successfully.
      At one time, Gawyn had no problem with the fact that he had killed his
      former teachers&mdash;they were rebelling against a lawfully raised
      Amyrlin&mdash;but he has since begun to feel guilty, wondering if he had
      truly chosen the just side.  It still eats at him.
      He has stated that he did not like
      Elaida&mdash;she had always been cold to him as his mother&rsquo;s
      advisor&mdash;but he supported her because he disliked what Siuan had
      done, involving Egwene and Elayne in her plotting.  Eventually, he
      learned that Egwene herself lead the rebels, and that she had been
      captured.  He stubbornly refused to believe she could <i>possibly</i> be
      safe as a prisoner, and vowed to do anything to rescue her.  He
      eventually jumped at the chance to help Siuan mount a rescue; Egwene was
      quite angry at him (and at Siuan) for disobeying her direct orders.
      Gawyn is finding it difficult to adjust to his relationship to Egwene
      as her Warder&mdash;he is used to being his own person, and finds it
      difficult to stand to the side.  <a href="#Silviana">Silviana</a> does not like him,
      thinking him impetuous and a danger to Egwene.  Unbeknownst to Egwene,
      he kept the three ring <i>ter&rsquo;angreal</i> from the Seanchan bloodknives
      he slayed in the Tower, not fully understanding what they do.
      His sign is a white boar.

      p. 69&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken, a fleshy woman with curled red-gold hair.
      Before the War of the Shadow, she became the leading authority on
      diseases of the brain, and spent much of her life dealing with the
      insane, schizophrenic, and others well beyond the touch of Healing.  She
      was the best at subtle manipulations of the human mind that ever lived.
      After the Bore was drilled, she went through a change after she realized
      the world could never live up to her standards.  So she began dressing
      in the very way she once mocked, with low cut dresses that clung to her
      and left little to the imagination.  After being released from the Bore,
      Graendal took up residence in Arad Doman, capturing several members of
      the Royal Family to use as servants.  All of her servants are not only
      physically well shaped and good-looking, but also had power in their
      society before she captured them.  She includes in her collection the
      sister of the Domani king, two rulers from Shara, and other important
      figures.  With <a href="#Sammael">Sammael</a> dead,
      <a href="#Moridin">Moridin</a> is the only person who knows how to find her.
      Graendal has been allowed limited access to the True Power through
      Moridin in recent days; she cannot take as much as she wants, but it is
      enough to, for example, take possession of a dove&rsquo;s mind and see through
      its eyes.  Unbeknownst to <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>, Graendal <i>survived</i> his
      attack on Natrin&rsquo;s Barrow.  Since he believes her dead, she
      feels she can plot against him&mdash;or someone else important to
      him&mdash;without anyone suspecting that she is involved.  The
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> was not happy that her actions resulted in
      the death of yet another of the Chosen, Aran&rsquo;gar,
      however, and put her soul in a new body.  Her new body is exceedingly
      ugly, the person of <a href="#Hessalam">Hessalam</a>.  She is now forbidden to use

      Halima was actually Aran&rsquo;gar, a reincarnated

      She was <i>causing</i> Egwene&rsquo;s headaches, and then making them subside,
      in order to keep herself close to Egwene.
      It worked&mdash;she usually slept on a pallet in Egwene&rsquo;s tent.
      She was stunningly beautiful, with big green eyes in a
      perfect face and a full, firm bosom.  As she was posing as a poorly
      educated serving girl, she formed her letters with the awkwardness of a

      p. 267&mdash;Wife of <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>

      had light hair similar in color to <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> and

      Therin&rsquo;s that used to flash through <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>&rsquo;s head, Ilyena
      never flashed her temper at Lews Therin when she got angry at herself.
      Lews Therin often wailed for her loss for hours on end; these rants were
      usually started by anything and everything having to do with women,
      love, hate, killing, friends, or enemies.  It is evident that
      <a href="#Demandred">Demandred</a> also fancied Ilyena, and the fact that she fell
      for Lews Therin only deepened his hatred of him.  She was the last of
      the names expunged from Rand&rsquo;s list.

  <li><a class="name" name="Isam">Isam Mandragoran</a>,

      through the Ways to attack Emond&rsquo;s
      Field when <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a> went back to defend it.  He was
      later sent by <a href="#Moridin">Moridin</a> to murder
      <a href="#Fain">Padan Fain</a>.  He is the same Isam that disappeared
      into the Blight years ago, Isam Mandragoran, <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>&rsquo;s
      cousin.  He has a mysterious ability to enter <i>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</i> in
      the flesh without a Gateway and leave it the same way, as well as change
      personalities and become <a href="#Luc">Luc Mantear</a>, the brother of
      <a href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</a> and uncle of <a href="#Galad">Galad</a>
      and <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>, who disappeared into the Blight years ago.  The
      Shadow&rsquo;s minions call him, &ldquo;the man with two souls.&rdquo;  He
      is also <a href="#Slayer">Slayer</a>.  He was recently assigned to kill
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>, with <a href="#Graendal">Graendal</a>&rsquo;s help.
      They failed, and instead caused Mesaana&rsquo;s death in the
      process.  He has also been assigned at various times to kill
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>, though the Forsaken continually give him new orders,
      distracting him from that task.  Isam went to the Shadow, hoping that
      he could be given the ability to channel; even the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> could not grant that, but he was able to
      unite Isam&rsquo;s soul with Luc&rsquo;s to make him unique.  Isam now considers
      himself a hunter, and that is all he desires to be.

      p. 67&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  He was the most powerful of the Forsaken, and during the Age
      of Legends he was a prominent philosopher and theologian named
      <a href="#Elan">Elan Morin Tedronai</a>.
      He was never really bound inside the Bore, and led the
      hidden forces of the Shadow for the three thousand odd years from the
      end of the War of the Shadow to the present.  He took credit for such
      things as convincing the then insane
      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>
      to kill everyone he loved, pursuading the dying
      <a href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a> not to accept the Aes Sedai
      Healing that might have saved his life, sending the Trollocs out of the
      Great Blight during the Trolloc Wars, and many other events in history
      that turned out poorly.  When the rest of the Forsaken were freed,
      Ishamael kept them away from each other&rsquo;s throats.  He confronted
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> at the Eye of the World, where he was severed
      from the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>&rsquo;s bonds; he confronted him again
      at Falme where Rand put his sword through him and melted it, but not
      after Ishamael gave Rand a wound that he has not been able to recover
      from yet; and he confronted Rand in the Stone of Tear after he took
      <i>Callandor</i>.  Rand killed Ishamael after beating him sore by
      plunging <i>Callandor</i> into his heart.  His body rotted quickly, but
      it was proof that Ba&rsquo;alzamon, which he called himself
      to the public, was a human being, and not the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>.  Ishamael has been resurrected in

  <li><a class="name" name="Narishma">Jahar Narishma</a>,
      p. 158&mdash;Man not
      much past twenty that had the spark of <i>saidin</i> inborn.  
      His father was a cobbler in Arafel.
      He is now one of the Asha&rsquo;man.  He is loyal to <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>,
      not <a href="#Taim">Taim</a>.  After being placed on the Traitor&rsquo;s List, he
      went in to hiding&mdash;he did not assist in the attack on Rand, but
      Rand thought it better to be safe than have him killed.  He has since
      been bonded as a Warder by <a href="#Merise">Merise</a>.  He wielded
      <i>Callandor</i> at the cleansing of <i>saidin</i>, though the circle
      was controlled by one of the women.  Merise took away his dragon pin at
      first, claiming it was not appropriate for him to wear it in lieu of his
      new responsibilites as her Warder&mdash;Jahar was very angry with her
      for this, and eventually learned to give him respect appropriate
      to his position.  Jahar was instrumental in exposing
      <a href="#Halima">Halima</a> and Delana;
      he detected a man trying to pierce the ward against eavesdropping around
      the Hall of the Tower, after which Delana promptly excused herself and
      she and Halima fled the camp.
      He traveled with <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> in Tear as one of three
      full Asha&rsquo;man in the group.  Rand realized that trusting Narishma
      was a near-insane risk, but one that was evidently worth taking.  It
      appears that his trust was not misplaced.  Narishma mentioned to Rand
      that he had not told him everything about how to disarm the wards he left
      around <i>Callandor</i>.  Rand was convinced he <i>had</i> told
      him everything, which is puzzling.  Perhaps Rand merely forgot,
      perhaps Rand had left it warded against disarmament by, say, someone
      other than him, and forgot about it before sending Narishma, or perhaps
      someone <i>else</i> set a trap for Rand, and Narishma discovered it and
      was able to spring it.
      Narishma&rsquo;s loyalty seems to indicate that he is <i>not</i> a
      Darkfriend.

      chief of the Taardad Aiel in memory.  He ended the blood feud between
      the Taardad and Nakai clans after over 200 years of fighting, and then
      allied not only with the Nakai, but with the Reyn Aiel as well (who were
      not much better than blood enemies before the alliance was made).  He

      <a href="#Tam">Tam</a>.  Kari met Tam while he was stationed in Caemlyn
      during his military duties, and the two got married.  They returned to
      Tam&rsquo;s home, Emond&rsquo;s Field, with the child he found on the mountain at the
      end of the Aiel War, which they named Rand.  Kari died when Rand was
      about five years old; she was the only mother Rand ever knew, and all he
      remembers of her was her soft touch.

      p. 153&mdash;Essentially the secretary to the

      The Keeper is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah the
      Amyrlin was raised from, and wears a stole of the color of her Ajah
      instead of the striped stole of the Amyrlin.  The post was held by
      <a href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</a> of the Blue Ajah until a coup deposed
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> and stilled both Siuan and Leane.  Her
      successor was <a href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</a>
      of the White Ajah, despite the fact that Siuan&rsquo;s successor was from the
      Red.  The Keeper for the Aes Sedai who fled the Tower when
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a> was raised Amyrlin named a Keeper of the
      Chronicles of their own, <a href="#Sheriam">Sheriam Bayanar</a> of the
      Blue Ajah.  In theory, the Keeper of the Chronicles serves the Amyrlin
      and speaks for the Amyrlin; she is all but separate from her Ajah,
      although less so than the Amyrlin Seat herself.  However, both Keepers
      during the division of the Tower tried to expand their powers over the
      Amyrlin they served, although for vastly different
      reasons&mdash;Alviarin essentially tried to weaken Elaida and have
      herself or another Black sister raised in her place after Elaida was
      deposed; Sheriam tried to overstep <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> because she had a
      hard time thinking of Egwene being anything more than the frightened
      novice that came to her study not so long ago, and her orders from the
      Shadow were to <i>support</i> Egwene, as it was assumed she would be
      weak and easy to control.  Alviarin was later deposed and replaced
      by <a href="#Tarna">Tarna Feir</a> of the Red Ajah.
      Sheriam was similarly deposed when she was exposed as being of the Black
      Ajah by Verin.  When Elaida was captured by the Seanchan
      and Egwene raised in her place, she chose
      <a href="#Silviana">Silviana Brehon</a> of the Red Ajah to be her

      Aiel killed Laman and took his sword.  Because of Laman&rsquo;s Pride, and his
      Sin, House Damodred lost the throne of Cairhien to House Riatin, and the

      very emotional&mdash;in fact, he has emotional walls all around him that
      he has been building for years.  His country, Malkier, was overrun by
      Trollocs shortly after he was born, and is now corrupted by the Great
      Blight.  Lan, among the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a
      one-man war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight.  He
      fought Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status.  He
      was eventually bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at
      least changed its style).  When Lan and Moiraine brought
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>, <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>,
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a>, <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>, and
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> out of their home in the Two Rivers, he
      found that there was something which could throw his guard down, but he
      was the last to notice it:  affection for Nynaeve.  As Moiraine put it,
      Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan&rsquo;s emotional walls and break them
      down without him even knowing they were there.  The two of them are now
      married.  According to the terms of their vows as taken before the Sea
      Folk, one of them must obey in public while the other obeys in private;
      for obvious reasons, Nynaeve is the one who commands in public.
      Upon Moiraine&rsquo;s death, Lan&rsquo;s bond was immediately transferred
      to <a href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</a> until Nynaeve was ready to have his
      bond transferred to her.  Myrelle tried to keep Lan&rsquo;s status secret, but
      she was given away when she tried to buy one of Lan&rsquo;s favorite foods,
      coin peppers, too far south (they are very popular in Shienar, and were
      in Malkier before it fell to the Blight, but do not grow well in
      southern climates).  Upon learning of where Lan was,
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> sent him to Ebou Dar to serve as a Warder
      for Nynaeve.  He traveled with his wife and the group of Aes Sedai
      she accompanied until he started to feel longing for his homeland.
      Nynaeve understood that he needed to finish his fight in the Blight,
      but she vowed to increase his chance of survival by dropping him off at
      World&rsquo;s End in Saldaea and alerting every surviving Malkieri she could
      find that Lan was marching for Tarwin&rsquo;s Gap. According to the Wise Ones,
      <i><a href="#Aan">Aan&rsquo;allein</a></i> (as the Aiel call him) will die the
      day he learns that Nynaeve is dead.  He is one of the best, if not
      <i>the</i> best, warriors, swordsmen, and Warders in the world.  Lan
      was determined to avoid all signs of civilization in the Borderlands,
      intending to ride to Tarwin&rsquo;s Gap himself.  Nynaeve had other plans,
      however; she visited dozens of locations throughout the Borderlands and
      alerted any Malkieri she could find of Lan&rsquo;s mission.  He intended
      to turn as many of them away as he could, but he had little choice in
      the matter&mdash;even <a href="#Kaisel">Kaisel</a>, Prince of Kandor, has joined
      his fight.  He eventually ended up with a small army, and is now one of
      the battle lords holding Tarwin&rsquo;s Gap against the Trolloc hordes in

  <li><a class="name" name="Lanfear">Lanfear</a>,
      p. 67&mdash;One of the Forsaken.
      Unlike the rest of the Forsaken, she chose her name for
      herself, which means &ldquo;Daughter of the Night&rdquo; in the Old
      Tongue.  She was born
      <a href="#Mierin">Mierin Eronaile</a>, and was
      very strong in the One Power.  She worked at the Collam Daan, the
      primary facility for research into the One Power.  Her final discovery
      there was what she thought was a new source for the One Power, one that
      could be harnessed by men and women alike&mdash;this source turned out
      to be the emissions through a thin spot in the Pattern from the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>&rsquo;s prison.  She and another Aes Sedai named
      Beidomon
      bored into the prison, creating what is now referred to as
      simply the Bore, allowing the Dark One to touch the world again and
      leading to the War of the Shadow.  Around this time, Mierin formed a
      relationship with <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, who headed
      the forces of the Light against the Shadow and was the most powerful man
      she had found.  Lews Therin broke off the relationship when he found
      that she only wanted him for his power and authority and the possibility
      of power for herself through him.  Mierin never let go of him, and when
      he later met and married <a href="#Ilyena">Ilyena Moerelle</a>, she
      tried to disrupt the wedding ceremony as well as split the two apart by
      any means.  Eventually, she went to Shayol Ghul to dedicate her soul to
      the Shadow, likely just to get back at Lews Therin for leaving
      her.  She declared as her territory the World of Dreams,
      <i>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</i>, using it to ends now unknown.  She transferred
      her obsessive love intact to Lews Therin&rsquo;s soul&rsquo;s new body,
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a>, after being freed from the Bore.  She
      first appeared to him as a young woman named <a href="#Selene">Selene</a>,
      but disguised her
      appearance as a slightly less beautiful (but still stunning) woman.
      Almost a year later, Lanfear found that Rand had been
      &ldquo;unfaithful&rdquo; to her, and she tried to kill him.  Before she
      could, she was pushed through the twisted stone doorway
      <i>ter&rsquo;angreal</i> leading to the land of the Eelfinn by
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>, becoming trapped.  She has since been reincarnated
      as <a href="#Cyndane">Cyndane</a> and fitted with a <i>cour&rsquo;souvra</i>, a Mind
      Trap, held by <a href="#Moridin">Moridin</a>.  The Eelfinn feasted on her ability
      to channel, or at least the pain and sense of loss she felt while they
      took it from her; she is not as strong as she used to be,
      but still stronger than <a href="#Graendal">Graendal</a>.
      According to Moiraine, Lanfear died because the Eelfinn drained her
      strength in the Power too quickly.  According to Moridin, it was
      Moridin himself who killed Lanfear, freeing her from the Eelfinn&rsquo;s
      grasp and allowing the Dark One to reincarnate her.  He killed both to
      save her and to punish her for her failures.

      She grew up in Arad Doman, and has coppery skin.  Just
      as her family members were training her in the seductive ways of Domani
      women, Leane found that her life would take a different direction:  she
      could channel <i>saidar</i>, and would do so with or without teaching.
      She became an Aes Sedai, a member of the Blue Ajah, and was eventually
      raised to <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a> under
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>.  During the coup
      led by <a href="#Elaida">Elaida a&rsquo;Roihan</a> and
      <a href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</a> that deposed Siuan, Leane was
      thrown in the dungeon and stilled.  Leane tried turning to her seductive
      side to try to replace what she lost in stilling; she was out of
      practice, but did well enough.  She eventually convinced the Aes Sedai
      in Salidar to let her stay with them and maintain the network of
      eyes-and-ears she kept in Tar Valon as Keeper.  She was later Healed by
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>, and restored to some of her former
      capacity for using the One Power.  The Hall of the Tower in Salidar
      decided that since she had been stilled, she was no longer Aes Sedai for
      that time and thus all of her titles and choice of Ajah were null and
      void.  Instead of petitioning to re-enter the Blue Ajah, she asked the
      Green Ajah if it would accept her; it did, and she became the first
      sister to ever switch Ajahs.  Her eyes-and-ears as Keeper are retained
      by her; she was the only Aes Sedai to plant spies in the city itself.
      These spies were very useful in determining both what is going on in Tar
      Valon and what the Ajahs were leaving out of their reports to
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>.  She has considerable strength with Earth,
      and is the second best at making <i>cuendillar</i>, after Egwene
      herself.  While carrying out Egwene&rsquo;s plan to turn the harbor chains to
      <i>cuendillar</i>, she was captured and held in the dungeons below the
      Tower.  She was allowed only one dress, the one in which she was
      captured, which she washed every third day in the remains of her bath
      water.  Now that the Tower has been reunited, Leane is held in some
      esteem among the novices and Accepted&mdash;not only was she stilled yet
      still channels, she changed Ajahs!  She has returned to her Domani ways
      with fervor, taking time every morning to put on makeup and dress
      seductively.  She even took time to put on makeup before the battle.

      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a> was deposed.  She is quite old.  She led one of the
      two factions that divided the Hall of the Tower under
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>.  Lelaine had a <i>strong</i> desire to
      hold the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a> herself, enough that once
      that Egwene was captured she nearly tried to seize it.
      She took to feigning support for Egwene to establish power in the
      Hall, anticipating that Egwene would not return.
      She is capable, strong-willed, and decisive.  She is not beautiful, but
      she <i>is</i> pretty, particularly when she smiles.  She is slender and
      graceful, with no gray in her dark hair.  Her face is almond-shaped,

  <li><a class="name" name="Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>,
      p. 28&mdash;The
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>, Breaker of the World.  He was perhaps the
      greatest man who ever lived, and the most powerful Aes Sedai in recorded
      history.  During the War of the Shadow, at the age of 400, he led the
      forces of the Light against the Forsaken, and led the final stroke which
      re-sealed the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> back into his prison.
      Unfortunately, during this stroke he was driven insane by the Dark One&rsquo;s
      touch, eventually killing his wife <a href="#Ilyena">Ilyena</a>, his children,
      and everyone he loved, as well as anyone who carried a drop of his
      blood.  For this act, people remember him with a new name:
      Kinslayer.  After he had done this,
      <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a> gave him his sanity back long enough
      for him to realize what he had done; Lews Therin killed himself by
      drawing on <i>saidin</i> too heavily, causing a mountain to form on the
      spot where he stood.  This mountain is called Dragonmount, and is near
      the present-day city of Tar Valon.  It is unfortunate that the name of
      one of the greatest men to ever live is now synonymous with evil, for
      Lews Therin killed his family due to the Dark One&rsquo;s influence, but
      without Lews Therin there may not have been a world left in which to
      kill them.  Lews Therin&rsquo;s voice often spoke inside
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>&rsquo;s head, offering advice or sobbing over lost
      women or ranting about killing men who could channel.  It even tried to
      seize control of <i>saidin</i> sometimes, much to Rand&rsquo;s
      fear&mdash;Rand was certain that Lews Therin could not take control of
      <i>saidin</i> away from him if he seized it first,
      but experience had shown that if Lews Therin seized it first,
      Rand would be at his mercy until he released.
      <a href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</a> revealed that Lews Therin&rsquo;s
      voice in Rand&rsquo;s head is not without precedent&mdash;indeed, hearing a
      real voice often indicates a person dangerously close to outright
      insanity.  Rand&rsquo;s time spent atop Dragonmount, when he destroyed the
      remaining Choedan Kal, seems to have liberated Rand&rsquo;s brain from the
      Dark One&rsquo;s touch&mdash;he no longer hears the voice in his head, and has
      effectively reunited Lews Therin&rsquo;s memories with his own inside Rand&rsquo;s
      head.  He also remembers what happened during Lews Therin&rsquo;s attack on
      the Bore.

      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a> who created war in Ghealdan and surrounding

      during the chaos surrounding the deposing of
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>,
      and eventually was escorted out of Tar Valon by Siuan and
      her traveling companions.  Before he was gentled, he was of considerable
      strength, and attracted quite a following of loyal soldiers.
      <a href="#Min">Min</a> still has viewings of him with a halo over his
      head, which she thinks indicates that he will become a figure of great
      power sometime in the future.  Logain later came forward with
      information that indicated that the Red Ajah actually put him up to
      declaring himself the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>, most likely
      with the pretext that bringing down a false Dragon would bring more
      glory than gentling a simple man who could channel.
      Logain was eventually Healed by <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>,
      and was set free by <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> to do as he pleased.
      He chose to go to the Black Tower,
      leading a part of the Asha&rsquo;man that seemed to be
      discontent with <a href="#Taim">Taim</a>&rsquo;s leadership.
      When Aes Sedai came to the Black Tower to attempted to capture the

      before his titles were stripped away when he declared himself the
      Dragon Reborn.  He traveled with the real Dragon Reborn,
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a>, for some time before returning to the
      Black Tower.  Taim and his cronies have captured Logain, and have been
      trying for some time to Turn him to the Shadow against his will.

      <a href="#Arent">Arent</a> son of <a href="#Halan">Halan</a>, an Ogier
      from Stedding Shangtai.  He left the <i>stedding</i> at around age 90 to
      see the world; by Ogier standards, he was not yet old enough to leave the
      <i>stedding</i> without permission from the Council of Elders.  He is
      fond of books and history, and is an excellent Treesinger.  He is
      writing a book about his travels with the three <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i> he
      meets, <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a>, <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>,
      and <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>.
      Loial was constantly afraid that his mother would find him and try to
      marry him off and settle him down; however,
      he does like his mother&rsquo;s choice of wives for him,
      <a href="#Erith">Erith</a>.  He, like most of the Ogier,
      is sad that most humans do not remember the Ogier, and is horrified that
      some even think he is a Trolloc on first seeing him.
      Loial&rsquo;s mother did indeed catch up with him; he and Erith are now
      married.  He spoke to the Stump at Stedding Shangtai, convincing them
      to intervene in the Last Battle.
      Loial is taking notes for a book, which will eventually be called
      <i>The Dragon Reborn</i> and will catalog
      everything he has been through with the three <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i> as well as
      any details he has been able to pry out of them.  He has always had a

  <li><a class="name" name="Masuri">Masuri Sokawa</a>,
      p. 857&mdash;Aes Sedai
      of the Brown Ajah.  She grew up in Arafel, and was part of Salidar&rsquo;s
      embassy to <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>.  She is now sworn to
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>, and travels with <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a>
      and company.  She is taller than Seonid by a hand.
      One of her largest interests as a Brown is the history of Darkhounds;
      she has been in contact with more Darkhound packs than just about anyone
      else alive (save the Forsaken).  She claims that she only met with
      <a href="#Prophet">The Prophet</a> to figure out how she could use
      him.
  <li><a class="name" name="Mat">Matrim (Mat)  Cauthon</a>,
      p. 22&mdash;A young
      man from Emond&rsquo;s Field.  He is <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i>.  Along with his good
      friends, <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a> and
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>,
      he left home to escape the Trolloc attacks after Winternight.
      On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger from Shadar
      Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which he carried
      with him for a long time.  He was separated from the dagger by Aes Sedai
      Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory sequence.  These
      gaps were filled and more when he passed through the twisted door to the
      land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three requests:  a foxhead
      medallion that protects him from women&rsquo;s channeling, a way out of the
      land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes that were the
      gaps in his memory.  Mat&rsquo;s <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i> qualities manifest themselves
      particularly well with random events, such as dice games&mdash;he almost
      never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are weighted.  He has
      found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling, and along with his
      newfound memories, he can win almost every battle he fights quite
      decisively.  He has four sisters, including Eldrin
      and Bodewhin, who were 16 and 17, respectively, when
      Mat left Emond&rsquo;s Field.  His
      father <a href="#Abell">Abell</a> is one of the best archers in the Two
      Rivers, probably in the World.  Mat has gotten in the habit of carrying
      concealed knives under his clothes in case he is attacked&mdash;his
      collection would surprise anyone.  In the Waste, he met a woman named
      Melindhra,
      a Maiden of the Spear from the Shaido Clan.  However, she was
      not the <a href="#9Moons">Daughter of the Nine Moons</a>, who Mat was
      destined to marry according to the Aelfinn; besides, she tried to kill
      him on orders from her master among the Darkfriends.  Mat had to kill
      her to save his own skin, but regretted it deeply.  He also has a scar
      along his neck from where the Eelfinn tried to hang him&mdash;which was
      also in accordance with what the Aelfinn told him, that he is
      &ldquo;to die and live again.&rdquo;  He created an army called the Band of the
      Red Hand, after the army of King Aemon of old
      Manetheren, and served in a way as Rand&rsquo;s personal general&mdash;this
      worked well, since Mat seems to be a better general than even
      <a href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</a>, who has earned his reputation as
      one of the best commanders alive.  Mat does not trust any Aes Sedai, at
      least not completely, and because of this he refuses to take his foxhead
      medallion off even to take a bath.
      Mat went to Ebou Dar to try to keep an eye on
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> and <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> and
      prevent them from getting themselves killed.  While there, he was
      cornered by <a href="#Tylin">Queen Tylin</a>, who gave him little choice
      but to become her lover, which he later described as the best game he
      had ever played.  When the Sea Folk and the Seanchan did battle
      in the city, he made his escape, leaving Tylin tied up under the bed so
      it looked &ldquo;official&rdquo;&mdash;Tylin was found torn limb from
      limb, obviously by the <i>gholam</i>, which was no doubt sent to kill
      Mat.  In the process of leaving, Mat also took several <i>sul&rsquo;dam</i>
      and <i>damane</i> (who were subsequently freed from their collars), and
      even kidnapped <a href="#Tuon">Tuon</a>, the
      <a href="#9Moons">Daughter of the Nine Moons</a> herself.
      Mat traveled with
      Valan Luca&rsquo;s show to keep out of Seanchan
      sight for quite some time.
      Tuon has now completed Mat&rsquo;s unwitting marriage ceremony;
      he is now among the highest of the Seanchan ruling class,
      the <a href="#Ravens">First Prince of the Ravens</a>,
      despite his insistence that he will fight the Seanchan during any battle
      if such battle is necessary.
      Tuon is (metaphorically) dead, in that she is now the
      <a href="#Empress">Empress</a> of Seanchan, <a href="#Fortuona">Fortuona</a>, though Mat still
      calls her Tuon, much to her dismay.
      He stubbornly refuses all Seanchan formality, which keeps Fortuona
      guessing and unsure what to make of him.
      Mat recently responded to <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>&rsquo;s letter to
      <a href="#Thom">Thom</a> rescuing her from the Eelfinn with the help of Thom
      and <a href="#Noal">Noal</a>.  Mat has an excellent eye for horses, which he
      inherited from his father&mdash;Fortuona judges him to have a better eye
      than the Imperial stablemaster.

      He had no real power anyway, since Sammael ruled Illian from the Council
      of Nine.  He was good-looking when he was younger, but he has not aged

      Black Ajah assistance (although this is completely unconfirmed).
      Hearing of <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>&rsquo;s amnesty, Taim came to Caemlyn and became
      the head of Rand&rsquo;s school of male channelers, now dubbed the Black
      Tower.  He is almost as strong in the One Power as Rand is.  Taim claims
      to have held off the madness that normally accompanies the taint for
      almost 35 years&mdash;he has been using the One Power for a very long
      time, and knows many tricks that Rand had not thought of on his own or
      been taught by <a href="#Asmodean">Asmodean</a>, such as how to test men
      for the ability.  He seems to resent being second to Rand, and also gave
      orders to kill Rand.  He is almost as tall as Rand, and has a hooked nose
      and dark eyes.  He is a physically powerful and graceful man, although
      his skill with a sword is lacking.  He gives special training to a
      growing number of Black Tower recruits&mdash;they are the only ones who
      wear the dragon besides <a href="#Logain">Logain</a>.  There is also little doubt
      that every last one of them is a Darkfriend, as is Taim.
      <a href="#Androl">Androl</a> and others have noticed that every one of these
      new recruits learns too quickly after the &ldquo;lessons&rdquo; start,
      and they often seem to have altered personalities as well.
      <a href="#Pevara">Pevara</a> revealed to Androl that those who can touch the True

      always works from safety, attacks from safety, and will run unless she
      can do so.  She developed a command of <i>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</i> that
      surpassed even <a href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</a>&rsquo;s mastery&mdash;in the
      real world, Lanfear was more powerful, but even she could not top
      Moghedien in the World of Dreams.  After being released from the Bore,
      Moghedien eventually found herself in Tanchico, in the Palace of the
      Panarch of Tarabon.  While there, she chanced upon
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara</a>, who was trying to save the
      <a href="#Amathera">Panarch</a> at the time and take the seal on the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>&rsquo;s prison from its hold in the Palace.
      She and Nynaeve fought in
      a duel to the last, and Nynaeve managed to better Moghedien, much to the
      surprise of both of them.  She managed to escape Nynaeve&rsquo;s tied off

      she ripped <a href="#Birgitte">Birgitte</a>&rsquo;s soul out of the World of

      Sedai of the Blue Ajah.  Born of a noble House in Cairhien, she is
      <a href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</a>&rsquo;s youngest half-sister, and
      <a href="#Laman">King Laman</a>&rsquo;s niece.  She is considered short among
      her people, and the Cairhienin are already a short people.  When it was
      discovered that she had the ability to channel inborn, Moiraine went to
      Tar Valon to become an Aes Sedai.  Just before being raised to the
      shawl, she and her friend <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> witnessed
      Gitara Moroso&rsquo;s Foretelling of the Rebirth of the
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>.  Moiraine and Siuan
      walked away from each other and did not speak to each other again (at
      least in public), but both held secret communication with each other and
      dedicated their lives to finding and guiding the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.  Moiraine found the young man she
      sought on Winternight in Emond&rsquo;s Field, a young man named
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a>, along with two more <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i>,
      <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a> and <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>,
      and two women with the spark of the Power inborn,
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al&rsquo;Vere</a> and 
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara</a>.
      When Moiraine was shortly raised to the shawl, she met
      <a href="#Lan">al&rsquo;Lan Mandragoran</a>, the uncrowned King of Malkier,
      who was fighting alone against the Shadow in the Borderlands;
      she eventually asked Lan to become her Warder, and he accepted.
      She was very strong in the Power, stronger than almost all living Aes
      Sedai before Egwene and Nynaeve came to the Tower.
      In the Stone of Tear, Moiraine confronted and killed the Forsaken
      Be&rsquo;lal with balefire, just before he would have
      killed Rand.  Later, after having an inkling of the future events from
      the testing <i>ter&rsquo;angreal</i> for the Wise Ones, Moiraine managed to
      push the Forsaken <a href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</a> through the twisted
      doorway <i>ter&rsquo;angreal</i> into the land of the Eelfinn, trapping both
      her and Lanfear there.
      Moiraine was the subject of the only viewing <a href="#Min">Min</a> had
      ever had that, so Min thought, could not come true.
      Min assumed it <i>could not</i> come true, as she thought Moiraine was
      dead, though of course she was not.
      According to a letter Moiraine wrote to <a href="#Thom">Thom Merrilin</a>
      the day before her death, she lived on in the land of the Finn,
      but her bond with Lan was severed.
      The same letter convinced <a href="#Mat">Mat</a> to help Thom rescue
      her, though her vision in the <i>ter&rsquo;angreal</i> apparently indicated
      disaster would result unless Mat <i>asked</i> to see the letter before
      Thom showed it to him.
      Other Aes Sedai consider Moiraine a legend, not only for
      discovering the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> but for killing or
      trapping two of the Forsaken as well as finding a future
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>.  Despite her efforts, and for the
      most part, success, <a href="#Cadsuane">Cadsuane</a> still thinks she
      &ldquo;bungled&rdquo; things with Rand.  Moiraine has been severely
      weakened in her strength in the One Power&mdash;the Eelfinn drained her
      strength from her, savoring in the agony they caused by doing so.
      After being rescued, she married <a href="#Thom">Thom Merrilin</a>, who
      was also involved in her rescue.

      trusting, more cruel.  Slowly it became so, until finally the city was,

      completely successful&mdash;instead, the two souls merged to create
      something more evil than either Mordeth or Fain alone.  Fain now feels
      incomplete without the tainted dagger that was removed from the city.

  <li><a class="name" name="Morgase">Morgase Trakand</a>,
      p. 245&mdash;Former
      Queen of Andor and High Seat of House Trakand.  Mother of
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> and <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>.  She
      married <a href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</a>, a prince of
      Cairhien, to further solidify her claim to the Throne of Andor and keep
      peace between the two nations; when <a href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</a>
      disappeared, Morgase made the best claim to succeed her, and married her
      widower to gain the support that would be gained by such action.
      Taringail was Elayne&rsquo;s and Gawyn&rsquo;s father; he died when they were young.
      Morgase has since gone through several lovers, including
      <a href="#Thom">Thomdril Merrilin</a>, a former court-bard;
      <a href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</a>, her First Prince of the Sword and
      Captain of the Guards; and most recently
      <a href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</a>,
      a man who led the faction that stilled the riots in Caemlyn
      that sprang up on Morgase&rsquo;s trip to Tar Valon to inquire about Elayne&rsquo;s
      whereabouts.  Thom was exiled from the city of Caemlyn when he started
      telling her what he really thought of some of her plans, her
      relationship with Bryne ebbed away until finally Gaebril told her to
      exile him too, and Gaebril eventually chased Morgase herself out of the
      city when she found he was usurping her power.  The Daughter-Heir of
      Andor is traditionally trained by Aes Sedai in the White Tower, and
      Morgase underwent novice training to keep the tradition alive.  She was
      given the gift of a Great Serpent ring despite not being Accepted, and
      still wears it on her left hand when possible.
      She was previously advised by
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a&rsquo;Roihan</a> of the Red Ajah, who
      she dismissed at Gaebril&rsquo;s suggestion; Elaida later became
      the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a> in Tar Valon.  When Morgase
      discovered that Gaebril (who, unbeknownst to her, was actually
      Rahvin) meant to usurp her throne, she fled, and
      when she learned that the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> had taken
      over Caemlyn and none of her former supporters would give her aid, she
      fled to Amadicia to get help from the only place she thought she could:
      Pedron Niall and the Children of the Light.  She
      was not aware that <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> only wanted to give her
      country back to her, not to mention believed that she was dead.  If she
      had made her presence known, she would no doubt have had her country
      back in one piece, but as royalty she believed she must work on her own
      and trust no one.  She went into hiding after the Seanchan attack
      (Eamon Valda
      believes her to be dead) under her mother&rsquo;s first name,
      Maighdin, to avoid instant recognition, and later
      became a maidservant to <a href="#Faile">Faile</a>; she told Faile that
      she was a lady&rsquo;s handmaid before coming into her service.  When Faile&rsquo;s
      group was captured, she became a prisoner of the Shaido, and was
      detained in their encampment.
      Morgase has come to many realizations about her life, and about her
      choice in men:  Taringail saw her as a pawn, Thom as a beauty to be
      hunted and romanced, Gareth Bryne as a queen to be served.  None had
      made her his entire life.  However, a former
      member of the Queen&rsquo;s Guard, Martyn Tallanvor,
      has taken a liking to his former queen, and she found herself almost
      unconsciously returning his attentions.  Her adopted son
      <a href="#Galad">Galad</a> believed her dead at the hands of Eamon
      Valda, and killed him in a duel on her behalf.
      Her son Gawyn believed her dead at the
      hands of the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>, and was only restrained
      from killing him by <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>&rsquo;s command.  Her
      daughter Elayne believed her dead as well (though she as yet has no
      plans for vengeance), and her new mistress Faile had no idea of her true
      identity.  Morgase&rsquo;s cover has since been blown:  she presided over
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a>&rsquo;s trial, finding insufficient evidence to demand his
      execution.  It is presumed that Gawyn and Elayne have heard the news
      that she is alive, or at least that they will find out soon.
      Her sign is three golden keys.

  <li><a class="name" name="Moridin">Moridin</a>,
      p. 25&mdash;Name given to
      the reincarnation of <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a>.
      His new body is tall, black-haired, handsome, and broad-shouldered,
      but with a prominent chin that ruins the look
      (in <a href="#Graendal">Graendal</a>&rsquo;s eyes, at least).  He is the same height as
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>.  His name means
      &ldquo;Death&rdquo; in the Old Tongue; no one deserves the name more.
      His first visit to the Town, a Shadow-controlled city near Thakan&rsquo;dar,
      resulted in the death of at least a dozen <i>Samma N&rsquo;Sei</i>, the
      red-veiled Aiel-born servants of the Shadow, many of them male
      channelers that were forcibly Turned to serve the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>.
      He is fond of using the True Power, the power drawn directly from
      the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>; the <i>saa</i> have appeared in his
      eyes, almost blackening them, yet he still controls his use of the
      True Power (most thought it impossible to avoid drawing too much of it
      once the <i>saa</i> appeared).
      Moridin is careful not to attempt to force the
      Pattern to behave how he wants it to&mdash;he knows that with someone as
      strongly <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i> as <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>, that is all but
      impossible, not to mention foolish.  Instead, he attempts to keep
      everything in chaos (as per the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>&rsquo;s
      command, &ldquo;Let the Lord of Chaos Rule&rdquo;), hoping that subtle
      manipulations will further his goals.  He has been declared
      <a href="#Naeblis">Nae&rsquo;blis</a>, the one to be second only to the
      Great Lord of the Dark after the Last Battle, and given control of the
      <i>cour&rsquo;souvra</i> controlling the minds of
      <a href="#Cyndane">Cyndane</a> and <a href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</a>; he has since relinquished
      Moghedien&rsquo;s to her own control.
      He has also been granted the exclusive privilege of using the True
      Power&mdash;the other Forsaken are no longer able to touch it even
      should they want to.
      Moridin helped Rand, in a way, during his fight with
      <a href="#Sammael">Sammael</a> in Shadar Logoth.
      Their two streams of balefire crossed, causing both of their heads to
      ring, and ever since then there has been a link between Moridin and
      Rand that neither one completely understands.  Its influence is clear,
      however:  now that Rand&rsquo;s hand is missing,
      Moridin&rsquo;s left hand does not work as well as it should.
      Moridin once granted <a href="#Graendal">Graendal</a> some limited access to
      the True Power, on a short leash, but the likelihood of him doing so
      again after her utter failure is remote.  He is a grand
      master at the game of Sha&rsquo;rah, a chess-like game from the Age of
      Legends; Moridin believes the game to be a distant memory of the battle
      with the Dark One during this Age from the previous turnings of the
      Wheel.  His connection with Rand allows Rand to enter his
      dreams, even when they are isolated in a Dreamshard.
      The same connection seems to have given Rand access to the True Power
      as well, which allowed Rand to escape <a href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</a>&rsquo;s Domination
      Band.  Moridin, or rather Ishamael, turned to the Shadow for reasons of
      logic:  following the Light meant the struggle continued forever,
      with no path to victory.
      Following the Shadow meant ruling for a short time before everything was
      destroyed.  Moridin believes that the struggle between his soul and
      Rand&rsquo;s has continued unabated since the beginning of time, and he
      longs for release from that cycle.

      p. 394&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Green Ajah with an elliptical face and olive skin.
      She is olive-skinned and beautiful, with long black hair and rounded
      curves.  She is
      young (she has worn the shawl for about fifteen years) and known for
      her temper.  She is now the Captain-General of the Green Ajah of the
      Tower-in-exile.  She has five Warders named Nuhel,
      Croi, Avar, <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>
      (<a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>&rsquo;s old Warder), and
      Llyw (Kairen&rsquo;s old Warder).
      She treats all of them as husbands in
      defiance of all law and custom, inside the Tower and out.  She fled the
      White Tower when <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a> was deposed, along with most
      of her Ajah.  She was one of the six sisters who held much of the power
      in Salidar despite not being part of the Hall of the Tower.  She
      received <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>&rsquo;s bond after
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>&rsquo;s death, bringing her Warder count to
      four, at least until <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> is ready to have him
      as a Warder, and later saved Kairen&rsquo;s Llyw as well.
      She seems to be the resident expert on saving Warders;
      four of her five (Nuhel, Avar, Lan, and Llyw)
      were previously bonded to other sisters.
      She claims this is because she hates watching Warders die once
      their Aes Sedai is dead.  Nynaeve&rsquo;s last task before being raised
      &ldquo;officially&rdrquo; was to demand that Myrelle pass Lan&rsquo;s bond to
      her.  She reluctantly did so, after being threatened.

      Compulsion, except with much darker forces at work&mdash;and he no

      p. 32&mdash;Young woman from Emond&rsquo;s Field, now an Aes Sedai
      of the Yellow Ajah.  She was the Wisdom of her village, the youngest
      such ever chosen in Emond&rsquo;s Field.  She left when four of her villagers
      were taken away from the Two Rivers by <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>
      and <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>.  While the group traveled away from her home
      and toward her new life, Nynaeve made several discoveries:  she could
      channel the One Power, and had already done so without really knowing
      what she was doing; she developed feelings for Lan Mandragoran,
      Moiraine&rsquo;s Warder and the uncrowned king of the now dead nation Malkier;
      and she has a major role to play, as all of her younger friends in the
      group do, in the years to come.  She is very strong in the One Power;
      only a select few who were alive during the Age of Legends could match
      her, as well as a few young women still being trained.  When she arrived
      in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a novice,
      despite not being able to even <i>sense</i> the True Source unless
      angry, a result of her having to learn some minimal control of her
      ability without teaching.  She was sent on a false mission by
      Liandrin on which she was almost leashed by the
      Seanchan as <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> was.  After she returned to the
      Tower, <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> sent her on a mission to hunt
      down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in
      Tanchico, she encountered <a href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</a> and managed
      to better her in a duel of the Power.  Moghedien escaped, but two
      encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her,
      leashing her with an <i>a&rsquo;dam</i> in <i>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</i>.  Nynaeve
      took Moghedien with her to seek out <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> and
      Rahvin while they were fighting each other, and at
      the last moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin
      to ash with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could
      draw to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain
      control of himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire.  Nynaeve then kept
      Moghedien under control with a modified <i>a&rsquo;dam</i> in Salidar until
      <a href="#Halima">Halima</a> helped her escape.
      Nynaeve wished to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she
      thinks the Tower meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and
      wants no part of it.  She is determined to Heal anything short of death,
      and has already managed to Heal gentling, as well as remove the effects
      of the taint from men&rsquo;s minds.  Nynaeve felt bad when
      Moiraine died, because her first thought was not of her, but that now
      Lan was free from their bond.  She was not told that Lan&rsquo;s bond had been
      passed to <a href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</a> at the moment of Moiraine&rsquo;s
      death.  She and Lan are now married, and Lan&rsquo;s bond was transferred to
      her the moment she tracked down Myrelle.  As Lan&rsquo;s wife,
      she is the Queen of Malkier; when Lan raises the Golden
      Crane and frees Malkier from the Blight, she will rule at his side.
      She now wears the <i>ki&rsquo;sain</i>,
      an ornament traditionally worn by Malkieri wives,
      consisting of a dot on the forehead between the eyes&mdash;Lan did not
      tell her of this tradition, but when she found out, she immediately took
      it up.  It is the one element of her appearance that never fades for one
      second when every other part changes faster than the eye can follow in
      <i>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</i>.  Because she was the only person Rand felt he
      could trust to link with him and the Choedan Kal, he asked Nynaeve to
      assist him when he cleansed <i>saidin</i>.  She now carries the
      <i>ter&rsquo;angreal</i> she found in Ebou Dar nearly all the time,
      making her collection of jewelry rival that of
      <a href="#Cadsuane">Cadsuane</a>.  She is even rumored to leave much of this
      jewelry on even when sleeping.  Nynaeve knew she could not prevent Lan
      from returning to the Blight to fight his one-man war, so she deposited
      him as far from Tarwin&rsquo;s Gap as possible while still remaining in the
      Borderlands, then alerted every surviving Malkieri she could find to
      Lan&rsquo;s mission.  Rand was shocked when he met her recently with her hair
      loose and cut to the shoulders&mdash;she had worn her braid proudly.

      He is short, pale, and quite ugly.  He likes to chase women.  He is a

      He has a certain fascination with the game Snakes and Foxes, and

<h2><a name="P">P</a></h2>
  <li><a class="name" name="Fain">Padan Fain</a>,
      p. 857&mdash;Former peddler
      that frequently came to Emond&rsquo;s Field.  A Darkfriend, he was given
      orders to locate the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> and narrowed
      the list of candidates to three boys in Emond&rsquo;s Field.  While
      persuing them, he encountered the spirit of
      <a href="#Mordeth">Mordeth</a> in Aridhol, now called Shadar Logoth.
      Mordeth attempted to consume Fain&rsquo;s soul, but instead the two souls
      merged, producing something more evil than either of them alone.  Fain
      no longer takes his orders from the Shadow; he has his own evil agenda.
      It is said, &ldquo;The look of the Eyeless is fear,&rdquo; from
      observing that a Myrddraal&rsquo;s look causes fear in the hearts of men.
      Fain&rsquo;s look has that effect on Myrddraal&mdash;Fades feel the same fear
      of Fain as men feel from a Fade.  Fain is also called
      <a href="#Ordeith">Ordeith</a>, a name he adopted to become a Whitecloak
      officer.  He is perhaps the most evil man alive.  He later served as
      advisor to Toram Riatin, one of the Cairhienin
      nobles in rebellion to <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>.  Rand has a bounty of
      100,000 gold crowns on his head&mdash;Fain killed Rand&rsquo;s friends because
      they were his friends, he pillaged his homeland because it was his
      homeland, and Rand intends to see him dead for it.
      Rand still bears the wound that Fain&rsquo;s dagger gave him;
      the evil from Fain&rsquo;s dagger fighting the evil from
      <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a>&rsquo;s staff gave Rand the idea he used to
      cleanse <i>saidin</i>.  Fain is now in the Great Blight, killing
      Shadowspawn for the sheer pleasure of it and waiting for Rand to arrive
      so he can kill him.  He can kill a Myrddraal simply by touching it with
      the <a href="#Mashadar">Mashadar</a>-like mist that exudes from him, and he can
      kill worms with ease.

  <li><a class="name" name="Perrin">Perrin t&rsquo;Bashere Aybara</a>,
      p. 18&mdash;A young man from Emond&rsquo;s Field.  He is <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i>.  When
      he and <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> got separated from the rest of the
      group while fleeing the Trollocs on Winternight, Perrin met a man named
      <a href="#Elyas">Elyas Machera</a>.  Elyas, a former Warder who found he
      could talk to wolves, helped Perrin discover the same ability in
      himself.  Perrin&rsquo;s eyes are now yellow, just like the wolves&rsquo; eyes, and
      he can enter what he calls the Wolf Dream (known to most as
      <i>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</i>, the World of Dreams) with them.  Perrin is a
      childhood friend of fellow <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i>
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a> and <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>.  On
      the way to Tear, Perrin encountered a young woman by the name of
      Zarine Bashere, a Hunter for the Horn who
      took the name of <a href="#Faile">Faile</a> (which means
      &ldquo;Falcon&rdquo; in the Old Tongue) as a more appropriate name for a
      Hunter for the Horn.  The two are now married.  Perrin is a very large
      man&mdash;he was always a big person, which caused him to be very
      cautious since he found as a child that he could easily hurt other
      children if his temper got out of hand.  His size helped considerably
      when helping <a href="#Luhhan">Master Luhhan</a> on his forge, but
      that combined with his careful nature sometimes gave others the
      impression that he is slow and stupid.  He returned to the Two Rivers
      for a time to repel the series of Trolloc attacks;
      he and his wife are recognized as Lord and Lady there, the
      first noblility of the Two Rivers since the Trolloc Wars.  When he
      returned, he began to draw the eye of
      <a href="#Berelain">Berelain sur Paendrag Paeron</a>,
      the First of Mayene&mdash;Perrin wants nothing more
      than to be as far from her as possible, but Berelain will not take no
      for an answer, much to Faile&rsquo;s dismay and intense jealousy.  Perrin was
      instrumental in freeing Rand from his entrapment at Dumai&rsquo;s Wells; the
      two had a fight afterwards (they had planned it as a way for Perrin to
      leave, although they most likely did not plan on it being as violent as
      it was), and Perrin went to Ghealdan to see if he could tame
      <a href="#Masema">Masema</a>.  On the way, his wife was captured by
      Shaido, and he spent weeks single-mindedly trying to track her down.
      He eventually formed an alliance with
      <a href="#Khirgan">Tylee Khirgan</a>, a Seanchan Banner-General,
      to help him defeat the Shaido and free his wife.
      Despite his strong desires to avoid both combat and lordship,
      Perrin has become a very good general and leader.
      Perrin witnessed Rand&rsquo;s internal battle on Dragonmount&rsquo;s summit.
      He has also been trained by the wolves in manipulating Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod;
      his skills have allowed him to fight Slayer, protecting wolves and
      humans alike in the process, though not without casualties&mdash;Hopper
      himself was killed in the process.  Perrin has become strong enough in
      Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod to halt a stream of balefire in its path&mdash;in so
      doing, he impressed upon Egwene that <i>nothing</i> is beyond the power
      of a strong enough mind in the World of Dreams, leading her to defeat
      the a&rsquo;dam Mesaana later placed on her and breaking Mesaana&rsquo;s
      mind in the process.  Perrin has since come to terms with the wolf in
      him, realizing now that he can reach the balance between man and wolf
      that is right for him.  The only thing that throws him off is love for
      Faile, but he now has realized that <i>she</i> is his link to his human
      side if he ever forgets.

      She is short for a Kandori, and quite plump, but
      tough.  She goes against all Red Ajah custom to openly say that Warders
      would make a Red sister&rsquo;s job easier.  She and her friend since
      novicehood, <a href="#Seaine">Seaine</a>, began the hunt for Darkfriends
      in the Tower.  Seaine approached her not only because they were friends,
      but because Seaine&rsquo;s family was killed by Darkfriends when she was
      young.  She joined the Red Ajah because its task was one which involved
      being outside the Tower often, and she considered it more likely to be
      able to find and bring to justice the Darkfriends that killed her family
      and others like them.  She led the organization of sisters in the
      White Tower to ferret out Black sisters, along with
      <a href="#Saerin">Saerin Sedai</a>, who seized control away from
      Seaine as soon as she knew what they were about.
      Pevara mysteriously disappeared from the Tower&mdash;in reality,
      she was one of the sisters leading the embassy of sorts to the Black
      Tower in which Red sisters offered to bond Asha&rsquo;man as Warders.
      Pevara is still at the Black Tower, a virtual prisoner to Darkfriends
      there.  Her seat in the Hall has been filled by another sister,
      either permanently or until she returns.  She has developed a friendship
      of sorts with <a href="#Androl">Androl Genhald</a>, one of the

      dressed in robes, telling him to kill Perrin Aybara.
      He convinced Aram that Perrin&rsquo;s yellow eyes were a result of him being
      Shadowspawn, which convinced Aram to attempt to kill Perrin.
      In his last moments before Faile killed him, the Prophet dimly remembers

      p. 27&mdash;A young man from

      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.  He is very tall, with curly
      red-blond hair and bright blue-gray eyes that shine like gemstones.
      He was raised by <a href="#Tam">Tam al&rsquo;Thor</a> and his
      wife <a href="#Kari">Kari</a> (until her death around the time Rand was
      five) in Emond&rsquo;s Field.  His real parents, however, were
      <a href="#Janduin">Janduin</a>, the chief of the Taardad Aiel who
      brought the four clans across the Dragonwall to punish
      <a href="#Laman">Laman</a>&rsquo;s Sin, and a Maiden of the Spear named
      Shaiel, who was actually
      <a href="#Tigraine">Tigraine Damodred</a>, the runaway
      <a href="#DH">Daughter-Heir of Andor</a>.
      Tigraine gave birth to Rand on the slopes of Dragonmount, in
      accordance with prophecy: &ldquo;born of a Maiden, of the ancient
      blood but raised by the Old.&rdquo;  Rand has a heron branded into
      each of his palms, which he received from the sword Tam gave him while
      fighting <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a>.  He also has two
      dragons on his forearms, which he received in Rhuidean to designate him
      as the <i><a href="#Caracarn">Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</a></i>, the Chief of Chiefs of
      the Aiel.  Until very recently, he had started wearing a new sword:
      curved, with a black scabbard, painted with two twisting dragons much
      like those on his forearms.  It was found under a submerged statue.
      He has since given this sword to Tam.
      He is not only the Dragon Reborn, but also
      He Who Comes With the Dawn,
      the man prophesied to reunite the Aiel, and
      the <a href="#Coramoor">Coramoor</a>, the one prophesied to bring the
      Sea Folk out of the Sea.  He can channel strongly, more so than any
      person who ever lived (except the previous users of his soul, including
      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, who were obviously of equal
      strength), and is also <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i>, the most strongly so since Lews
      Therin as well.  Lews Therin&rsquo;s voice seemed to have found a new place
      inside of Rand&rsquo;s head for some time;
      he talked to him in a mad voice when Rand least expected it,
      sometimes offering sound advice or knowledge, sometimes babbling,
      sometimes even trying to wrest control of <i>saidin</i> from him.
      <a href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</a> revealed that hearing this voice was a symptom of
      the madness associated with touching tainted <i>saidin</i> for as long
      as Rand did.  Rand has since managed to create some sort of barrier
      between the effects of the taint and his mind; the net effect is that
      he is no longer insane, but retains all of Lews Therin&rsquo;s memories, all
      his knowledge, and all his experience.
      Unlike Lews Therin, Rand is accompanied by two other
      <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i> during this turing of the Wheel, two men born within days
      (hours, even) of him named <a href="#Mat">Matrim Cauthon</a> and
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>, who both grew up in Emond&rsquo;s Field
      as well.  Rand is destined, according to <a href="#Min">Min</a>&rsquo;s viewings,

      <a href="#Min">Min Farshaw</a>, <a href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</a>,
      and <a href="#Aviendha">Aviendha of the Tardaad Aiel</a>.
      Rand has had success in fighting many of the Forsaken;
      all to confront him have died or been trapped.
      He killed <a href="#Aginor">Aginor</a> at the Eye of the World after the
      Green Man killed
      Balthamel; he allowed
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> to kill
      Be&rsquo;lal in the Stone of Tear, and killed
      <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a> in the Stone shortly afterward; in the
      wagons near the Spine of the World, <a href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</a>
      confronted him and was pushed into the land of the Eelfinn by Moiraine,
      where she was subsequently tortured by the Eelfinn and partially
      drained of her ability to channel until &ldquo;rescued&rdquo; by
      Moridin;
      he killed Rahvin in <i>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</i> when he
      came to the Royal Palace in Caemlyn;
      <a href="#Asmodean">Asmodean</a>, his teacher, was killed shortly after
      Rahvin met his fate; <a href="#Sammael">Sammael</a> met his fate while
      fighting Rand in Shadar Logoth at the hands of <a href="#Mashadar">Mashadar</a>;
      Osan&rsquo;gar, the reincarnation of
      <a href="#Aginor">Aginor</a>, died at Shador Logoth when Rand was
      cleansing <i>saidin</i>;
      <a href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</a> was captured during her attempt
      to capture Rand and bind him with a Domination Band (a sort of male
      <i>a&rsquo;dam</i>), and later died at his hand when she succeeded in binding
      him when he accessed the True Power through his connection to
      cossref(&ldquo;Moridin&rdquo;);
      and Aran&rsquo;gar died when he attacked
      <a href="#Graendal">Graendal</a>&rsquo;s hold at Natrin&rsquo;s Barrow.
      During his duel with Sammael, Rand encountered
      a mysterious wanderer, who turned out to be <a href="#Moridin">Moridin</a>, who
      helped him.  During the fighting, their streams of balefire collided,
      causing Rand&rsquo;s head to spin and both of them to lose coherency for a
      while.  Afterwards, Rand had trouble seizing <i>saidin</i> due to the
      taint&rsquo;s effect on his mind.   During his first fight with Semirhage,
      Rand had his hand burned away by her weave of Fire;
      Moridin has since been seen favoring his left hand,
      as if Rand&rsquo;s injury is somehow affecting him.
      Since the hand cannot be repaired,
      Rand has moved on without it&mdash;others compared it to the
      reaction one might have after losing a glove.
      Rand was captured for a brief period by <a href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</a>,
      after Shaidar Haran freed her from her captivity
      at Aes Sedai hands.  She attempted to force him to choke Min to death,
      but Rand&rsquo;s connection to Moridin allowed him to access the True Power,
      and he used that connection to weave balefire and destroy Semirhage.
      Thereafter, Rand steeled himself to do what he must,
      without emotional influence, without distraction from feelings, until
      finally the emotions grew too much to handle&mdash;he finally Traveled
      to Dragonmount, standing upon his own grave in fulfillment of Prophecy,
      and contemplated his life, and all of his past lives, finally
      determining that life and creation were not worth it unless you could
      laugh and cry.  He destroyed the male Choedan Kal, and
      seems to have blocked his madness somehow in the process.
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> attempted to Heal his madness, but he is beyond her
      abilities.
      Rand&rsquo;s prophecies fulfilled grow:  he has already
      been born on the slopes of Dragonmount of a Maiden, of the ancient blood
      but raised by the old; taken the Stone of Tear and drawn
      <i>Callandor</i>; and began conquering &ldquo;under the forgotten
      symbol,&rdquo; that of the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  The
      &ldquo;spotless tower&rdquo; (i.e., the White Tower) broke and
      bent knee to him&mdashthe Tower has broken, several Aes
      Sedai have sworn fealty to him and only him, and even the
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin</a> herself has agreed to work with him.
      He slayed &ldquo;his people&rdquo; (the Aiel) with the &ldquo;sword
      of peace&rdquo; and destroyed them &ldquo;with the [Way of the]
      Leaf&rdquo; (referring to his dividing the Aiel with news that they used
      to be a peacful, non-violent people).  He has &ldquo;wounds of
      madness&rdquo; from Fain&rsquo;s dagger (and from the taint), and has
      led the Aiel spears &ldquo;from the city, lost and forsaken&rdquo;
      (Rhuidean).  And of course, he has stood &ldquo;on his own grave&rdquo;
      and wept, referring to his scene at Dragonmount where he went from
      being &ldquo;blind&rdquo; to the reasons for life to
      &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; the reasons of life again.
      Some time ago, he used the
      Choedan Kal, the two great <i>sa&rsquo;angreal</i> created during the War of
      the Shadow, to cleanse the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>&rsquo;s taint from
      <i>saidin</i>.  He has created schools of sorts, more research
      universities, where some of the best inventors of the day have
      congregated, near Cairhien, Caemlyn, and Tear to develop new technology.
      Rand has also created the Asha&rsquo;man, men who came for his
      &ldquo;amnesty&rdquo; for male channelers.  With <i>saidin</i> cleansed,
      the Asha&rsquo;man are now safe from the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>&rsquo;s taint.
      The Asha&rsquo;man themselves are not free from the Dark One&rsquo;s
      <i>influence</i>, however; there are many Darkfriends among the
      Asha&rsquo;man, including <a href="#Taim">Mazrim Taim</a>, the leader of the
      Black Tower.  The Asha&rsquo;man under Taim once turned on Rand, trying to
      kill him and worse, though Rand did not at that point know that they
      were acting with Taim&rsquo;s knowledge.  Rand used to believe that
      emotionlessness was the key to surviving to do what he must do, but he
      now realizes he must instead accept what must be done, not letting it
      bother him but still feeling it.
      Rand is the salvation of the entire
      world, and as the prophecy states, he <i>will</i> save the
      world&mdash;and Break it again.  <i>Editor&rsquo;s note:  there has been some
      speculation as to the origin of Rand&rsquo;s new sword.  Some suggest that it
      is Justice, the sword of Artur Hawkwing.  I submit
      that the dragons wrapped around the blade suggest a much earlier origin:
      the sword of Lews Therin Telamon himself.</i>

  <li><a class="name" name="Seaine">Seaine Herimon</a>,
      p. 108&mdash;Sitter
      for the White Ajah in Tar Valon.  She grew up in Altara, and has a
      fondness for cats.  She is described as stately, with thick black hair
      and eyebrows and watery blue eyes.
      She was the daughter of a Lugard furniture maker,
      and is a bit above average height.  When the Hall was arguing
      over who to raise as <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin</a> years back, it was
      deadlocked over four candidates who had each worn the shawl about fifty
      years; the Hall wanted an Amyrlin that was younger than the eighty or
      more years than were common.  Seaine suggested
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>,
      then a young Blue sister that had worn the shawl for only
      ten years; she was eventually raised.  Later, Seaine was charged by
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a> to find Darkfriends in the Tower; Elaida
      hopes to expose <a href="#Alviarin">Alviarin</a> on the suspicion that
      she is Black Ajah.  She and her friend since novicehood,
      <a href="#Pevara">Pevara</a>, have successfully captured and bound with
      the Oath Rod a member of the Black Ajah, and have since dug out more
      Black sisters, even revealing that Galina Casban,
      head of the Red Ajah herself, was secretly Black.
      Seaine eventually found that she was set to her task because of a
      misunderstanding:  Elaida asked her how she was getting along
      &ldquo;with discovering proof that Alviarin entered a treasonous
      correspondence with the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.
      Elaida&rsquo;s exact words were, &ldquo;We can never be sure who has the
      shadow of treason in her heart, Seaine.  Why, I suspect that someone
      arranged for an order of mine to be countermanded.  And I have reason
      to believe that someone has communicated privately with
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a>; to what end, I cannot say,
      but that surely is treason against me, and against the Tower.
      I charge you to follow the stench of treason,
      no matter where it leads or how high,
      even to the <a href="#Keeper">Keeper</a> herself.  Yes, even to her.
      What you find, whoever it leads to,
      you will bring before the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a> alone,
      Seaine.  No one else must know.&rdquo;
      Seaine interpreted this to mean Darkfriends in the Tower,
      and therefore assumed Elaida could not be a Darkfriend.
      She and her associates were no longer so sure after realizing what she
      had actually said, so they stepped carefully.
      <a href="#Ferane">Ferane</a> wanted Seaine raised Amyrlin when Elaida was
      captured.  Seaine and her cohorts have since become some of

      p. 38&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  During the Age of Legends, she was one of the
      best Healers ever known.  She was called to all corners of the world to
      Heal people that others thought beyond help.  However, she was sadistic;
      she exacted a price in the form of pain from her subjects in return for
      her Healing services.  Most thought the pain or anguish she exacted from
      them was a small price to pay for being alive, but eventually the Hall
      of Servants found out about her practices and gave her the choice of
      being either severed or bound with the Power, never again to know her
      &ldquo;pleasures.&rdquo;  She chose instead to pledge for the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>, and created one of the most oppressive and
      pain-filled areas of Shadow control during the entire War of Power.
      She became an expert at sadism and torture; she considers her greatest
      achievement to be a weave which removes the victim&rsquo;s blood and replaces
      it, instantaneously, with another liquid that causes every nerve in the
      body to fire with pain simultaneously&mdash;the victims typically
      survived about an hour.
      After being freed from the Bore, Semirhage went in service to the Dark
      One by extracting information from captured Borderlanders and Aes Sedai.
      She also sent the Trollocs to the Stone of Tear to battle those that
      <a href="#Sammael">Sammael</a> sent.  She was as tall as most men, and
      wore black most of the time&mdash;perhaps because
      <a href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</a> always wore white.  It is often joked (or
      used to be, when the Forsaken were still bound) that when it rained
      during the daylight that the Dark One was beating her.
      According to <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin</a>&rsquo;s memories,
      Semirhage always enjoyed a challenge.
      She had an uneasy alliance with Mesaana and
      <a href="#Demandred">Demandred</a>
      before she was captured by <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> after her unsuccessful
      attempt to capture him.  She had been posing as
      Anath Dorje, <a href="#Tuon">Tuon</a>&rsquo;s Truthspeaker.
      It is a virtual certainty that she murdered the previous Truthspeaker in
      order to gain the office.  She was eventually given a Domination Band by
      Shaidar Haran, and used it to capture
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>.  She Compelled Elza Penfell,
      who was a Darkfriend, to help her control him by wearing the other

      choking her to death&mdash;she would have succeeded, but Rand&rsquo;s
      connection to <a href="#Moridin">Moridin</a> let him seize the True

      prison kept him from touching the world until it was bored into by Aes
      Sedai during the Age of Legends.  This hole, called the Bore, allowed
      the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new outbreaks of
      war, treachery, violence, and crime.  The attempt to free the Dark One
      completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the War of Power by
      some, especially those on the Shadow&rsquo;s side), during which a number of
      important leaders forsook the Light and gave their lives to the Dark
      One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of the
      most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  The War of the Shadow
      did not end until <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, the
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>, and his Hundred Companions Traveled to
      Shayol Ghul and re-sealed the Dark One back into his prison, trapping
      the Forsaken with him.  At the moment of sealing, Shai&rsquo;tan lashed out at
      those sealing the prison, driving them insane and tainting <i>saidin</i>
      itself, the male half of the True Source, dooming all male Aes Sedai to
      madness as well and starting the Time of Madness.  These seals are
      weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the Dark One is
      once again able to exert influence on the world.  These seals were
      scattered throughout the world by Aes Sedai during the Breaking of the
      World.  In order of when they were discovered, they were found:  1) At
      the Eye of the World (broken when it was found); 2) in the hands of
      <a href="#Domon">Bayle Domon</a>, later pilfered by
      High Lord Turak of the Seanchan (broken at the
      battle of Falme), 3) On Seanchan, part of High Lord Turak&rsquo;s collection
      (broken at the battle at Falme); 4) In the Great Hold at the Stone of
      Tear (still intact); 5) In the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace in Tanchico (broken
      enroute to Salidar); 6) One in Rhuidean (still intact), and 7) Found by
      <a href="#Taim">Mazrim Taim</a> on a small farm in Saldaea (still
      intact).  Despite being made of <i>cuendillar</i>, the three that remain
      unbroken can be cut with a knife and would break by a fall from a table.
      According to the Forsaken, the Dark One is capable of destroying
      anything, just as the Creator is capable of creating
      anything&mdash;similarly, anything that the One Power can do,
      the True Power can undo.
      The Dark One is also referred to by other euphemisms, including
      Sightblinder, Lord of the Grave, Father of Lies, Grassburner,

      <a href="#Novices">Mistress of Novices</a> in the White Tower before she
      fled to Salidar with the rest of her Ajah.  She led the group of six

      part of the Hall of the Tower.  Her tilted green eyes were used to
      intimidate novices and Aes Sedai alike.  She became the
      <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a> under
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al&rsquo;Vere</a> among the rebels.
      She was very efficient, but she
      hated the paperwork involved with being Keeper, and was often heard
      muttering under her breath that she wished she were still Mistress of
      Novices.  She lost a considerable amount of weight in the months
      before her death.  She was beaten, apparently as a way to extract
      information, by an unknown assailant during those weeks.
      She often wished she had chosen the Brown Ajah, which would have allowed
      her to isolate herself from the Tower, politics, and stress in
      general.  Known to almost no one (except Verin) until
      shortly before she was exposed and executed by Egwene, Sheriam was

      Egwene watched Sheriam&rsquo;s execution personally, listening to her confess

      out against Elaida&mdash;she went as far as calling Elaida out, in front
      of the Hall, for her actions as Amyrlin, which she pointed out were
      only useful for sowing dissent and distrust among the sisters.
      She claimed the Red Ajah should be embarrassed by having one of their
      own behave that way as the leader of the Aes Sedai.  Elaida managed to
      shift some of the blame away from herself, then prompty imprisoned
      Silviana in the deepest cells in the Tower dungeons.
      Egwene was impressed enough with Silviana&rsquo;s behavior&mdash;both in
      doing her duty as she saw it by beating Egwene, no matter how much she
      resented doing it, and in being brave enough to stand up to Elaida when

      her previous standing in the new Tower that separated from
      Elaida&mdash;her knowledge of the Blue Ajah spy network is hard to
      match, and she knows much that she thought would be of use.  In one of
      her viewings, <a href="#Min">Min</a> saw that Siuan would have to remain
      close to <a href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</a>&mdash;if she did not, both
      of them would die.  Siuan did not initially know what she meant, but now
      realizes that she is growing to love the gray-haired man who leads the
      rebel army.  She later realized that the viewing was related to the
      attack on the Tower by the Seanchan.
      Siuan had a Warder named Alric, but he
      was murdered by Elaida when Siuan was deposed.  After coming to Salidar,
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> discovered how to restore Siuan&rsquo;s ability
      to channel, at least partially.  This resurrected a part of her bond
      with Alric, but did not bring back her former strength, or her binding
      by the Oath Rod.  She could lie as well as any child, at least until she
      re-swore the Three Oaths shortly before the Tower was reunited.
      She served as an advisor of sorts to the new Amyrlin in Salidar,
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al&rsquo;Vere</a>, but though she put on a
      fa&ccedil;ade of hating the work, she was actually one of Egwene&rsquo;s
      foremost agents.  The fact that she was Aes Sedai, not to mention one
      who was stilled and Healed again, made other sisters tend to be
      oblivious to that fact.  She was pushed very hard by Elaida as a novice.
      While Egwene was being held prisoner in the Tower, Siuan was charged
      with keeping the factions among the rebels&mdash;headed by
      <a href="#Romanda">Romanda Cassin</a> and
      <a href="#Lelaine">Lelaine Akashi</a>,
      respectively&mdash;from usurping the rebellion and placing
      <i>themselves</i> on the Amyrlin Seat.  When the Seanchan attacked,
      Siuan decided she had had enough of Egwene&rsquo;s stubborn insistance not to
      rescue her.  She easily convinced <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a> to come with her,
      and eventually convinced <a href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</a> to come with
      as well, on two conditions:  she bond Bryne as her Warder, which she
      did immediately, and that she marry him.  The second condition has since
      been met as well.  Bryne saved her life when a Seanchan assassin creeped
      up behind her while she was Healing Bryne&rsquo;s troops; he thrust his sword
      into the apparition&rsquo;s chest area, knowing that he would die if the blow
      did not land, and saved her life.  She then saved <i>his</i> life by
      Healing him of the poison the assassin injected right before dying
      himself, thus satisfying Min&rsquo;s viewing, it seems.
      Siuan has an unusual Talent:  she can see <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i>.
      She said <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> &ldquo;blazed like a torch&rdquo; the first
      time she saw him, in reference to the strength of his <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i>
      abilities.

      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a> once hunted him, chasing him through
      <i>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</i> all the way to the Tower of Ghenjei.
      He did not see much of him for months afterward,
      though Slayer has been busy again in recent weeks:
      he enjoys killing wolves, considering them good sport.
      The Shadow uses his ability to enter and leave the World of Dreams at
      will to assassinate people thought important to the Light&rsquo;s cause.  He
      once tried to kill <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> and <a href="#Min">Min</a> in their sleep,

      form he seems to prefer in the real world.  Luc is Rand&rsquo;s uncle, which
      Luc is aware of but Rand is not.  The wolves describe his scent as
      &ldquo;inhuman,&rdquo; like a man mixed with stone.
      Slayer, in Isam&rsquo;s form, is muscular and tanned, with thick arms,
      dark hair, and blue eyes.  He closely resembles Lan, his face all angles
      and sharp lines.  Slayer, as Isam, enjoys the hunt.  Slayer, as Luc,
      is more accommodating.  Slayer, as either soul, hates Perrin with a
      rabid passion.

      p. 37&mdash;Limber,
      long-armed Warder to Hattori with rough-hewn
      features.  His face is filled with sharp lines.  He has a cleft chin, a
      hooked, once-broken nose, and jutting cheek bones.
      He is a Blademaster.  Shadows cover his eyes.
      He was one of two Warders who was with the eleven Aes Sedai that escaped
      Dumai&rsquo;s Wells, though Sleete barely escaped with his skin.
      His story could have been drawn from legends:  he had lain wounded for
      hours before managing to pull himself into the saddle by the reins;
      the horse carried him, nearly unconscious, for hours before arriving
      at a village, where the villagers had been tempted to sell him to a
      group of bandits.  The mayor&rsquo;s daughter argued for his life,
      convincing everyone that only Darkfriends would seek wounded Warders.
      The villagers hid him, and the girl nursed him to health.
      He was forced to leave in secret, as the girl had taken a liking to
      him, but in return he hunted down the bandits and killed them so they
      would never trouble the village again.
      Hattori told him she would not take a second Warder unless Sleete
      believed the person to be worthy.
      He is one of the only Warders to have ever bettered
      <a href="#Lan">Lan Mandragoran</a>, back when Lan still practiced with
      the other Warders.  Sleete beat Lan in two of their seven duels, and
      Lan is widely considered the best Warder and Blademaster in the world.
      However, <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a> beats Sleete in every duel, even
      when Sleete has a capable partner.
      Sleete asked Gawyn if he would be interested in being Hattori&rsquo;s second
      Warder; Gawyn politely declined.  Sleete now lends his services to

  <li><a class="name" name="Thom">Thomdril (Thom)  Merrilin</a>,
      p. 169&mdash;Gleeman who came to Emond&rsquo;s Field on Winternight just before
      the Trollocs came.  He is quite the ladies&rsquo; man.  Thom is very good at
      juggling, sleight-of-hand, and all kinds of other
      tricks&mdash;<a href="#Rodel">Rodel Ituralde</a> once saw him performing
      at the Royal Court, and to say that he was impressed was to say that
      the sun is hot.  He also
      carries several concealed knives up his sleeves, in his boots, and in
      various other locations on his body; this practice seems to have spread
      from Thom to <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>, <a href="#Min">Min</a>, and
      <a href="#Faile">Faile</a>.  Thom was originally a bard in
      <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a>&rsquo;s Royal Court, and for a time after
      her husband <a href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</a> died, he was the
      Queen&rsquo;s lover.  During his run from a Fade at Shadar Logoth, he was
      injured, and now walks with a limp because of it.  Thom is getting old,
      such that he is starting to realize that he cannot do the backflips and
      other stunts he used to do.  He accompanied <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>
      and <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> on their travels as per
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>&rsquo;s request, despite the fact that he has
      never felt comfortable around Aes Sedai since his nephew,
      Owyn, was
      gentled by the Red Ajah.  Thom is an expert in the Game of Houses; in
      fact, his girlfried Dena
      was killed by Cairhienin soldiers because they
      thought he was trying to play <i>Daes Daemar</i> against the Royal
      House.  Thom received a letter from <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> after her
      battle with <a href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</a> stating that she was still
      alive in the land of the Eelfinn.  He, Mat, and <a href="#Noal">Noal</a>
      managed to rescue her, alive though weakened in the One Power.  He and
      Moiraine are now husband and wife.  He is extremely good at reading
      people.

      people commented on his striking resemblance to Tigraine; this is no
      coincidence, since Tigraine is Rand&rsquo;s mother.  She fled to the Aiel
      Waste upon a warning from Gitara Moroso to become
      a Maiden of the Spear, and gave birth to Rand when the Aiel were
      fighting near Tar Valon.  Her maiden name was Mantear.

      back in as part of her travels with <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>).
      She was also called the <a href="#9Moons">Daughter of the Nine Moons</a>,
      the woman Mat was told he will marry.  Mat later
      kidnapped her (in a matter of speaking), and she traveled with him under

      She is very small&mdash;short and slender.  She is,

      face, short black hair in tight curls against her scalp, and dark skin.
      Her hair is sprinkled with white at her temples.
      She is from Maram Kashor, a dry island off the southeast tip of
      Seanchan.  Her ancestors traveled with Luthair.
      She made a pact with <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>
      to fight the Shaido in exchange for any Wise Ones they could capture

      For her service to the Empire, she was made Lieutenant-General and

      Four Winds, Guardian of the Sea of Storms, High Seat of House Mitsobar,
      until her recent death.
      Her kingdom was small, and she only ruled a portion of it; the rest was
      governed by nobles who were not necessarily loyal to her.  She was the
      second from her House to sit on the throne&mdash;this was the maximum
      traditionally, and the only House to hold it for four generations fell
      so fast from power that it could not recover.  She was advised by
      Merilille Ceandevin of the Gray Ajah.  She was
      a widow, and did not plan to marry again.  She took an interest in
      <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>, and contrary to Mat&rsquo;s usual tactic of
      chasing women, <i>she</i> chased and caught <i>him</i>.  The
      two were lovers for some time; Mat thought she was a <i>very</i> fun
      quarry.  When the Seanchan invaded her nation,
      she cooperated with them out of necessity&mdash;they let her keep her
      position of authority, but she was a puppet of the Crystal Throne.
      When the Sea Folk fought the Seanchan, destroying much of Ebou Dar in
      the process, Tylin suggested Mat use the opportunity to escape the city,
      and tie her up under the bed to make it look like he had to restrain
      her to escape.  While she was bound and gagged under the bed, the
      <i>gholam</i> came, presumably to kill Mat, and she fell easy prey to
      it.  She was found by <a href="#Suroth">Suroth</a>&rsquo;s people the next
      morning, torn limb-from-limb.
