      He is believed to be the strongest Aes Sedai of all time, as well as
      the most strongly <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i> individual in recorded history.
      His banner was a white field with a four-footed serpentine creature
      (a dragon) on it.
      This banner was given to <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a> after it was
      discovered that he was the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.
      Unfortunately, Lews Therin went mad along with the rest of the Hundred
      Companions, finally killing his wife, children, and everyone he loved.
      He was thus given the name <a href="#Kinslayer">Kinslayer</a>,
      and his name is now associated with evil in the eyes of many.
