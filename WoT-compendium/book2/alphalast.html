      (50)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Red Ajah, and advisor to
      <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A> of Andor.  She sometimes has the

      when he was brought before the Queen after falling over the palace wall.

      false Dragon who created war in Ghealdan before he was gentled
      by Aes Sedai.  Not only could he channel, but he was of strength
      greater than most other male Aes Sedai, living or dead.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aerwin">Aerwin, Teven</A>, p. 75 (67)&mdash;Author
      of <I>The Dance of the Hawk and the Hummingbird</I>, a book

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aginor">Aginor</A>, p. 339 (299)&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  He was bound very close to the surface of the Bore during
      the Age of Legends; he was the second Forsaken to be released.  Aginor
      was killed by <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> at the Eye of the World.  His
      memory was part of <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>'s test for Accepted.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Nela">al'Caar, Nela</A>, p.
      344 (303)&mdash;Woman from Emond's Field.  In the world of the testing

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Paet">al'Caar, Paet</A>, p. 346 (305)&mdash;Man
      from Emond's Field, husband of <A Href="#Nela">Nela</A>.  In the

      after <A Href="#Malena">Malena</A>, the Wisdom, scrawled the
      <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>'s Fang on his door after he told her she
      didn't have Nynaeve's skill with healing.  She declared him to have
      sinned by opposing her, killed his two sons in their sleep, and turned
      his wife against him&mdash;Nela went mad and proclaimed him to be
      the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="ElnorealMeara">al'Meara, Elnore</A>, p. 350
      (309)&mdash;<A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>'s mother.

      Nynaeve names her daughter after her own mother.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Nynaeve">al'Meara, Nynaeve</A>, p. 7&mdash;A young
      woman from Emond's Field.  She was the Wisdom of Emond's
      Field prior to leaving to help four members of her village return home
      after they left with <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>.  Moiraine
      tells her that she has the ability to channel the One Power with
      great strength, and that it is this ability that allows her to
      &ldquo;listen to the wind.&rdquo;  While traveling with Moiraine and
      company, Nynaeve develops feelings for <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>.  He
      shares her feelings, but is unable to act on them due to his duties as a
      Warder.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Kari">al'Thor, Kari</A>, p. 129
      (114)&mdash;<A Href="#Tam">Tam</A>'s wife.  She died when

      <A Href="Tam">al'Thor, Tam</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Rand">al'Thor, Rand</A>, p. 2&mdash;A young man,
      about twenty years of age, from the Two Rivers.  He began
      his life as a shepherd on his father's farm outside of Emond's
      Field, and became
      good friends with <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A>, <A Href="#Perrin">
      Perrin Aybara</A>, and <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A>.  After
      leaving the Two Rivers with <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> and
      traveling to the Eye of the World, Rand discovers not only that he is
      able to channel the One Power, but that he is the
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>, the man prophesied to save the
      world from the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Tam">al'Thor, Tamlin (Tam)</A>, p. 4&mdash;Father
      of <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>.  Tam served as a soldier in
      the Illianer army during one of the wars with Tear, and then as an
      officer in the army against the Aiel in the Aiel War.  During his
      tenure as an officer, he attained Blademaster status and was awarded a
      heron-mark sword.  During the Battle of the Shining Walls, he found an
      infant boy on the slopes of Dragonmount.  His mother was dead, and Tam
      could not let the child freeze to death.  He and his wife, a woman from
      Caemlyn named <A Href="#Kari">Kari</A>, returned with the child (which
      they named <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>) to Emond's Field.  It is unknown
      whether Tam had any idea that the child he was raising was the
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Kari">al'Thor, Kari</A>; <A Href="#Rand">al'Thor, Rand</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alwyn">al'Van, Alwyn</A>, p. 14&mdash;Cobbler of
      Emond's Field.  It was he who made
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s boots&mdash;Rand did not see why Alwyn's work
      needed to be replaced when <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> ordered
      new clothes made for him.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Bran">al'Vere, Brandelwyn (Bran)</A>, p. 344
      (303)&mdash;Innkeeper of the Winespring Inn in Emond's Field, and
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>'s father.  He is dead in the world created
      by the testing <I>ter'angreal</I> that <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>
      experiences during her test to become one of the Accepted.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Egwene">al'Vere, Egwene</A>, p. 7&mdash;A young
      woman from Emond's Field.  She was all but promised to
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> from a young age, but they both feel somewhat
      uncomfortable now that they know that Rand is the
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.
      Like <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>, Egwene is told that she can
      channel the One Power, and that she has the capability to be the
      strongest Aes Sedai in a thousand years (besides Nynaeve).  She is
      on her way to Tar Valon to become a novice in the White Tower.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Marin">al'Vere, Marin</A>, p. 344 (303)&mdash;Wife
      of <A Href="#Bran">Bran</A>, mother of
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>.  She appears in
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>'s test for Accepted.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Huan">Aladon, Huan</A>, p. 497 (438)&mdash;Seanchan
      officer, assistant to <A Href="#Turak">High Lord Turak</A>.
      He was born and raised in House Aladon.  He sports the
      typical Seanchan officer's hairdo:  one side is shaved clean, the
      other quite long and done in a braid.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Turak">Aladon, Turak</A>, p. 429 (378)&mdash;Leader
      of Those Who Come Before (i.e., the Seanchan raiders).  His
      head is shaved bald, and his fingernails are about an inch long.  He
      wears a long, blue silk robe brocaded with birds that drags on the
      floor for a long distance behind him.  He has a collection of
      <I>cuendillar</I> figurines, including (thanks to the addition he took
      from <A Href="#Domon">Bayle Domon</A>'s ship) two seals on the
      <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>'s prison.  It is these seals that
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> finds broken after the battle at
      Falme.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alar">Alar</A>, p. 502 (443)&mdash;Eldest of

      grandmother and <A Href="#Iva">Iva</A>'s mother.
  <Li><A Class="name">Aldieb</A>, p. 145

      Warder, bonded to <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>, the Amyrlin Seat,
      for almost twenty years.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Ellaine">Alshinn, Ellaine Marise'idin</A>, p. xii
      (ix)&mdash;Chief Librarian at the Court of Arafel in 231 NE.  She translated
      the Karaethon Cycle.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aludra">Aludra</A>, p. 398 (352)&mdash;An
      Illuminator.  She is concerned that <A Href="#Tammuz">Tammuz</A> is
      not as prepared for the display as he says he is.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alwhin">Alwhin</A>, p. 574 (504)&mdash;The
      blue-eyed <I>sul'dam</I> who was supposed to control
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> after she was leashed.  Since the
      Seanchan failed to capture her, Alwhin has become very impatient.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Amalasan">Amalasan, Guaire</A>, p. 127
      (112)&mdash;False <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A> who commanded a large army
      during the time period from Free Years 939-943.  He was able to channel
      the One Power with great strength.  During his campaigns, he laid siege
      to the Stone of Tear in hopes of taking <I>Callandor</I>, and tried to
      take Tar Valon as well.  Unfortunately for him, another young king came
      to power during his life, a young man named <A Href="#Hawkwing">Artur
      Paendrag Tanreall</A>, later known as Artur Hawkwing.  Hawkwing put an
      end to Amalasan's conquest of the world, and conquered it for himself.
      <I>Note that Amalasan's name was misspelled as Amalasin when he first
      appears in this book.</I>
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Anaiya">Anaiya</A>, p. 47&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Blue Ajah, one of the two Aes Sedai to greet
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> upon entering Fal Dara.  She has dark
      hair.
      Her smile is perhaps the only beauty she will ever have, but that is
      enough for her&mdash;everyone feels comforted, perhaps even special,
      when Anaiya smiles at them.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Anla">Anla</A>, p. 484 (427)&mdash;The Wise
      Councilor from one of <A Href="#Thom">Thom</A>'s stories.  <I>Note:  I
      have seen it speculated that Anla is a shortening of the name Ann
      Landers, from </I>our<I> century.  It may indeed be the inspiration for
      the name.</I>
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Arent">Arent</A>, p. 383 (337)&mdash;Ogier,
      father of <A Href="#Loial">Loial</A>,

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Ashin">Ashin</A>, p. 460 (405)&mdash;Guard at
      the gates of <A Href="#Barthanes">Lord Barthanes</A>'s manor.  He is the

      and their &ldquo;escort&rdquo; to guide them to the party.
  <Li><A Class="name">Atuan</A>, p. 580 (511)&mdash;Namesake of the town Atuan's
      Mill, a village on Almoth Plain.
      <I>This Atuan is not to be confused with Atuan Larisett,
      an Aes Sedai.</I>
  <Li><I><A Class="name" Name="Aven">Avendesora</A></I>, p. 108
      (96)&mdash;The Tree of Life of Legend.  It leaves no seed, and was
      guarded by the <A Href="#Green">Green Man</A>,
      at least according to Legend.  In reality, the Green Man had nothing to
      do with the Tree of Life.
      <I>See also <A Href="#Avendo">Avendoraldera</A></I>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Perrin">Aybara, Perrin</A>, p.      7 (6)&mdash;A young man from Emond's Field, and a good friend of
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> and <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A>.
      While he was staying with <A Href="#Elyas">Elyas Machera</A>, he
      found that he has the ability to talk to wolves.  Once this ability
      manifested itself, his eyes took on the yellowish color of wolves'
      eyes.  He is bigger than most people, a fact which greatly helped him
      as a blacksmith's apprentice, but the fact that he often underestimates
      his strength has caused him to be very cautious.  He carries a large
      battle ax at his belt.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Corin">Ayellin, Corin</A>, p. 347 (305)&mdash;Woman
      from Emond's Field.  In the world of the testing
      <I>ter'angreal</I>, she is the only person (according to
      <A Href="#Marin">Marin al'Vere</A>) that will listen to reason and get
      rid of <A Href="#Malena">Malena</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Marisa">Ayellin, Marisa</A>, p.      518&mdash;Girl from Emond's Field who thinks <A Href="#Mat">Mat
      Cauthon</A> is handsome.  <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A> says that
      Marisa has a face like a goat, but this was just to spite Mat.  She is
      actually about as pretty as <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>, according to
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Neysa">Ayellin, Neysa</A>, p. (456)&mdash;Woman from
      Emond's Field, mother of <A Href="#Marisa">Marisa</A>.  <I>Neysa is
      mistakenly named as the girl who finds Mat handsome in some editions
      of the books; Neysa is of course the mother, and Marisa the daughter
      near Mat's age.</I>
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Malena">Aylar, Malena</A>, p. 345 (303)&mdash;The
      Wisdom of Emond's Field in <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>'s
      test for becoming one of the Accepted.  She is not a kindly Wisdom,
      even going as far as poisoning the children and then healing them
      to make it appear that she is helping.

<H2><A Name="B">B</A></H2>
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Baal">Ba'alzamon</A>, p.
      xxi (xix)&mdash;Name assumed by <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A> (one of the
      Forsaken) and used by Trollocs, Myrddraal, and Darkfriends when he calls
      them together.  The name means &ldquo;Heart of the Dark,&rdquo; and is
      believed by the rest of the world to be the Trolloc name for the
      <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>.  Ishamael does nothing to keep his
      followers from believing he <I>is</I> the Dark One.
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Sheriam">Bayanar, Sheriam</A>, p.      206 (182)&mdash;Mistress of Novices in the White Tower.  She is an Aes Sedai of
      the Blue Ajah.
  <Li><A Class="name">Bela</A>, p. 145 (128)&mdash;The horse that
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> rides.  She was originally
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s farm horse back in Emond's Field.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Myrelle">Berengari, Myrelle</A>, p. 323
      (285)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah.
      She currently has three Warders, and
      treats each of them as a husband.  She was selected by
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> as the one Moiraine would pass
      <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>'s bond to in the event that she died before he
      did.  She agrees to keep Lan only as long as necessary, before another
      Aes Sedai can be found to pass Lan's bond to.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Bili">Bili</A>, p. 156 (137)&mdash;Serving
      boy and nephew of the innkeeper of Easing the Badger, an inn in
      Illian where <A Href="#Domon">Bayle Domon</A> receives an offer that
      he finally accepts.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Blaes">Blaes of Matuchin</A>,
      p. 383 (337)&mdash;Character
      out of legend who will be called back from the dead by the
      Horn of Valere.  According to <A Href="#Thom">Thom</A>,
      <A Href="#Seaghan">Seaghan</A> has hired a band of people to
      impersonate such characters.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Dain">Bornhald, Dain</A>, p. 72
      (64)&mdash;Son of <A Href="#Bornhald">Geofram Bornhald</A>.  He is full of

      Valda</A> gives him without thinking them through first.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Bornhald">Bornhald, Geofram</A>, p. 71
      (63)&mdash;Lord Captain of a band of the Children of the Light.  He is a
      principal conspirator in the plot to overthrow <A Href="#Morgase">Queen
      Morgase</A>.  Like all Children of the Light, he despises anyone
      trained in the White Tower.  He is the best battle commander amongst
      the Children, with the exception of <A Href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</A>
      himself.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Bors">Bors</A>, p. xvi (xiii)&mdash;Pseudonym
      assumed by a Darkfriend and member of the Children of the Light
      (the Hand of the Light, in fact)
      present at a conference with <A Href="#Baal">Ba'alzamon</A>.
      During the conference, he is given orders to track
      the wherabouts of three young men from the Two Rivers,
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, <A Href="#Mat">Matrim
      Cauthon</A>, and <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A>.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Carridin">Carridin, Jaichim</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Bryne">Bryne, Gareth</A>, p.      51 (46)&mdash;Captain-General of the Queen's Guards in Andor.  Since
      <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A> had no living brothers, she chose Bryne
      to be her First Prince of the Sword in place of a brother.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Cenn">Buie, Cenn</A>, p. 32 (29)&mdash;Member
      of the Village Council of Emond's Field.  He is quite old, and quite

      the Mayor of Emond's Field.
  <Li><A Class="name">Bull, Young</A>, p. 227 (200)&mdash;Name the wolves
      give to <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A>.  They chose it for him,
      without his knowledge, after he killed two of the Children of the
      Light in a wild rage.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Byar">Byar, Jaret</A>, p. 75 (66)&mdash;Second to

      of two thousand Whitecloaks that Bornhald commands.
  <Li><A Class="name">Byrne, Gareth</A>, p. (47)&mdash;Misspelling of

      occur throughout the series.</I>

<H2><A Name="C">C</A></H2>
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Caban">Caban</A>, p. 424 (373)&mdash;Seanchan
      soldier that stays aboard <I>Spray</I> during her voyage from the place
      of Seanchan capture to Falme.  He has nothing but contempt for anyone
      from east of the Aryth Ocean.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Cain">Cain, Gaidal</A>, p. 383
      (337)&mdash;Character out of legend who will be called back from the
      dead by the Horn of Valere.
