  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Abell">Abell Cauthon</A>, p. 218
      (172)&mdash;<A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>'s father.
      He is the best horse trader in
      the Two Rivers.  He wins the quarterstaff competition at Bel Tine
      almost every year, and when he does not, <A Href="#Tam">Tam al'Thor</A>
      does.  He came to Tar Valon at one point to find out if Mat was still
      alive.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Adden">Adden</A>, p. 447 (358)&mdash;Captain of
      a leaky boat that the men who kidnapped <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>,

      taking the three unconscious women to.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Agelmar">Agelmar Jagad</A>, p. 151

      (450)&mdash;Wise Woman (the Tairen equivalent of a Wisdom) in Tear.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Lan">al'Lan Mandragoran</A>, p. 42
      (26)&mdash;Uncrowned
      king of Malkier, a nation now swallowed by the Great Blight.  For years,
      he fought a one-man war against the Shadow in the Blight, until being
      bonded as a Warder by <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>.  Lan is one of
      the best Warders, but he is very hard and stubborn, and is thus hard for
      Aes Sedai to deal with.  He keeps a stone countenance, never revealing
      his true feelings to anyone&mdash;although sometimes he cannot hide his
      feelings for <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>.
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Moiraine">Damodred, Moiraine</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alanna">Alanna Mosvani</A>, p.

      out of the Illuminators' Guild because she was blamed for spoiling the
      performace for King Galldrian of Cairhien.
      The problem was actually <A Href="#Tammuz">Tammuz</A>'s fault (or so
      they thought), but she was a more convenient target.  The mishap for
      Galldrian was actually caused by <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>, p.
      96 (71)&mdash;Chief position among the
      Aes Sedai.  She is elected unanimously by the Hall of the Tower, and
      is considered to be of all Ajahs and at the same time of none.  The
      office carries considerable influence; kings and queens, even if
      they hate Aes Sedai, will come if the Amyrlin calls them.  The office
      is currently held by <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>, raised from
      the Blue Ajah.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Siuan">Sanche, Siuan</A>.

      hopes of taking over all lands east of the Aryth Ocean and west
      of the Aiel Waste.  He was the most strongly <I>ta'veren</I>
      person in all of history except <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin
      Telamon</A> and <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, so strong that people
      claimed they could almost &ldquo;feel&rdquo; the Pattern bending
      around him when they were in the same room.  His death set off
      the War of the Hundred Years.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Artur">Artur Paendrag Tanreall</A>, p.
      (559)&mdash;Full name of <A Href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</A>, a

      known world except for the island city of Tar Valon.

      Chora Trees, products of the Age of Legends.  The location of
      <I>Avendesora</I> is unknown, though it apparently has some connection
      with the Aiel; they gave the people of Cairhien a gift over 500 years
      ago of a tree, <I><A Href="#Avendoral">Avendoraldera</A></I>, that was
      grown from a cutling of <I>Avendesora</I>.

      helps free them when they are captured.
      <I>Editor's note:  In later books, Aviendha's sept is referred to as

      who recently ascended to the Council of Nine in Illian.  The rest of the

      It is also traditional for the Daughter-Heir and her oldest brother
      (who will become First Prince of the Sword when she becomes Queen) to
      train in Tar Valon, but Elayne is the first Daughter Heir, indeed, the

      to channel the One Power inborn, as did her Wisdom
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>, and
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> took her along to Tar Valon
      so she could learn some control over it.  This probably saved
      her life, since three out of four women who have to learn the
      way Nynaeve did do not survive.  Egwene has long dark hair and
      dark eyes.  It was generally expected that she would marry
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, but the two ended up loving
      each other more as siblings&mdash;besides the fact that Rand is the
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>, a fact which would impede

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Elayne">Elayne Trakand</A>, p. 133

      Farshaw</A>, p. 43 (27)&mdash;Young woman from Baerlon.  She
      dresses in men's clothing, a habit she picked up while
      assisting her father in his mine.  She has dark eyes and dark
      hair.  She has a special talent, that of seeing images or auras
      around people that predict their futures.  Min does not think the
      ability is all that great, since her viewings often forecast
      death, pain, or other unpleasant circumstances for those they
      represent.  One of her viewings surprised her:  she is destined
      to fall in love with <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, but is
      also destined to &ldquo;share&rdquo; him with two other women.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Else">Else Grinwell</A>, p.

      traveling to Caemlyn.  She has eyes for men, according to Mat.  She
      delivers a message to <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>,
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>, and <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> to
      look through the things from <A Href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</A> and
      her fellow Black Sisters' things under the library.  The really

      several days earlier for failing to do her work....
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Elyas">Elyas Machera</A>,

      when he and <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> were separated
      from the rest of their group and chanced upon his campsite.
      He lives in company of wolves all the time, and has the
      same yellow color to his eyes that Perrin has.  He taught
      Perrin that he <I>can</I> communicate with wolves, but he

      in the center of the city of Cairhien.  This act, known as Laman's Sin,
      prompted three clans of the Aiel to cross the Spine of the World and
      avenge the death of the tree by taking his life.  The tree had been a
      gift from the Aiel in gratitude for the hospitality the people of
      Cairhien had displayed to them in the past.  It is unknown whether
      Laman knew of the significance of <I>Avendoraldera</I>, or of the
      reason the Aiel allowed the people of his kingdom to cross the Waste.
      The fact that he cut the tree down and brought the Aiel over the

      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> to
      be born on the slopes of Dragonmount, born of the ancient blood (Aiel)

      <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A> back into his prison, ending the Age
      of Legends and beginning the Time of Madness.  Unfortunately, Lews
      Therin was driven insane along with the rest of the Hundred
      Companions with whom he resealed the prison; he went mad and
      killed everyone he loved as well as anyone who carried so much as
      one drop of his blood.  For this reason, he was given the name
      Kinslayer, and his name is generally associated with evil, especially
      among the uneducated.  He is especially despised by the Whitecloaks,
      the &ldquo;Children of the Light,&rdquo; who by their very name should be
      serving him.  It is unfortunate that one of the greatest men who ever

      three young men, all of whom were <I>ta'veren</I>, who were born

      would most likely be stilled for if their full extent were known.

      He discovered that he can talk to wolves while he and

      He carries a curved battle ax and recently acquired a blacksmith's

      <A Href="#Selene">Selene</A>, Tam came to Tar Valon along with
      <A Href="#Abell">Abell Cauthon</A> to find out if Rand and
      <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A> were still alive.  Tam is from Emond's Field, but
      he left for several years to fight as a member of the Illianer army.  He
      rose to Blademaster status, and acquired a heron-mark sword, which is
      now in Rand's possession.  He married a woman from Caemlyn,
      <A Href="#Kari">Kari</A>, and then was called to duty to fight the Aiel
      in the Aiel War.  During the Battle of the Shining Walls near Tar Valon,
      he found a young boy on the slopes of Dragonmount, which he adopted and
      took back to Emond's Field.  Tam had no idea that this
      child was the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  <I>See also</I>

      believes) when the display for <A Href="#Galldrian">King Galldrian</A>
      went awry, but she was blamed for it since she was the Mistress of the
      Chapter House.  In reality, the mishap was due to
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s interference and that of Trollocs.

      Daemar</I>, the Game of Houses; he could and does play it in his sleep.
