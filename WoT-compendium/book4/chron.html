  <li><a class="name" id="Creator">The Creator</a>,
      p. 9 (ix)&mdash;The creator
      of the Universe, people, places, things, the True Source,
      everything in existence.  An alternate name would be God.  After He
      created the world, the Creator made a prison for
      <a href="#Dark">Shai&rsquo;tan</a>, the Dark One, his complete opposite in
      every way, to keep him from influencing the world.  The Creator is bent
      on non-interference&mdash;He will not directly influence events in the
      world, instead using a &ldquo;Chosen One&rdquo; or tugging at the
      Pattern of the Age in hopes that what He wants to occur will occur,
      instead of just making it happen.

      p. 9 (ix)&mdash;Counsel-Sister to
      <a href="#Comaelle">Comaelle</a>, High Queen of Jaramide.  She wrote
      <i>Commentaries on the Karaethon Cycle</i> c.&nbsp;325 AB, in the Third

  <li><a class="name" id="Dragon">The Dragon</a>,
      p. 13 (1)&mdash;Name by which
      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a> was known during the War of the
      Shadow.  His rebirth, the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>,
      is now alive and fulfilling all of the prophecies set to accompany
      him.

  <li><a class="name" id="Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>,
      p. 14 (2)&mdash;Leader of the Aes Sedai.  She is appointed for life by the Hall
      of the Tower, whose decision must be unanimous.  Once appointed and
      installed, the Amyrlin Seat is said to be &ldquo;of all Ajahs and
      none,&rdquo; regardless of which Ajah she was raised from, although this
      is often overlooked in the history and politics of the Tower.  The post
      is currently held by <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>, formerly of the
      Blue Ajah.  She is the youngest person ever to hold the office: she
      gained it when she was only thirty years old.

      <a href="#Siuan">Sanche, Siuan</a>.
  <li><a class="name" id="Min">Elmindreda (Min)  Farshaw</a>,
      p. 14 (2)&mdash;A young woman from Baerlon.  She gives her full name to
      <a href="#Faolain">Faolain</a> in hopes that the
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin</a> will be the only one to recognize it and
      know who she is&mdash;the name is actually out of a story,
      and the character who her mother took it from spent most of her time
      sighing at men.  It is also the name Min assumes while in the Tower to
      make sure people do not learn her true identity.  Min has a special
      ability that few besides herself know about:  she sees images and auras
      around people, especially around Aes Sedai and Warders, that Foretell
      their futures.  Min does not always know what these viewings mean, but
      when she does, it <i>will</i> happen; it is only a question of how and
      when.  Min was fascinated by the number of images she saw around
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>, especially the one she saw that included
      herself:  three different women are destined to fall in love with him,
      one of which is herself.

      <a href="#Rand">al&rsquo;Thor, Rand</a>.
  <li><a class="name">Dark One</a>,
      p. 15 (3)&mdash;Name,
      used in every land, for <a href="#Dark">Shai&rsquo;tan</a>.
      <i>See</i>
      <a href="#Dark">Shai&rsquo;tan</a>.
  <li><a class="name" id="Moiraine">Moiraine Damodred</a>,
      p. 15 (3)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah.
      She was born Lady Moiraine of House Damodred in Cairhien.
      She is <a href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</a>&rsquo;s youngest
      half-sister, and <a href="#Laman">King Laman</a>&rsquo;s niece.
      She is strong in the One Power, and is Talented at Healing.
      Along with <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>, her friend as a
      novice, she dedicated her life to finding and guiding the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>
      after hearing of his birth Foretold by
      <a href="#Gitara">Gitara Moroso</a>,
      who was then <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>.
      Her Warder is <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>, the uncrowned king of Malkier.
      She is determined to guide <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> to what must be done,
      and is very confident in herself that she knows the way.

      <a href="#Siuan">Sanche, Siuan</a>.
  <li><a class="name" id="Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>,
      p. 16 (4)&mdash;The
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>, Breaker of the World.  He was
      perhaps the greatest man who ever lived, and the most powerful Aes Sedai
      in recorded history.  During the War of the Shadow, he lead the forces
      of the Light against the Forsaken and led the final stroke which
      re-sealed the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> back into his prison.
      Unfortunately, during this stroke he was driven insane by the Dark One&rsquo;s
      touch, eventually killing his wife, his children, and everyone he loved,
      as well as anyone who carried a drop of his blood.  For this act, people
      remember him with a new name:  <a href="#Kinslayer">Kinslayer</a>.
      After he had done this, <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a> gave him his
      sanity back long enough for him to realize what he had done; Lews Therin
      then killed himself by drawing on <i>saidin</i> too heavily, causing a
      mountain to form on the spot where he stood.  This mountain is called
      Dragonmount, and is near the present-day city of Tar Valon.  It is
      unfortunate that the name of one of the greatest men who ever lived is
      now synonymous with evil, for Lews Therin killed his kin due to the Dark
      One&rsquo;s influence, but without Lews Therin there may not have been a world
      left in which to kill them.

      <a href="#Rand">al&rsquo;Thor, Rand</a>;
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon, The</a>;
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>;
      <a href="#Kinslayer">Kinslayer</a>.
  <li><a class="name" id="Kinslayer">Kinslayer</a>,
      p. 16 (4)&mdash;Name given to <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a> after he
      killed his family in his madness.
      <i>See</i>
      <a href="#Lews">Telamon, Lews Therin</a>.
  <li><a class="name" id="Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a>,
      p. 17 (4)&mdash;The <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.  He was raised as a
      shepherd in Emond&rsquo;s Field, but his birthplace was on the slopes of
      Dragonmount.  His adoptive father, <a href="#Tam">Tam</a>, found him freezing
      cold and orphaned while fighting Aiel on the mountain, and he took him
      home and raised him as a son.  Rand is <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i>,
      perhaps the most strongly so since the <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>
      himself, even more strongly than <a href="#Hawkwing">Arturn Hawkwing</a>.
      Rand has already fulfilled many prophecies of the
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>, including being born on the slopes of
      Dragonmount, being marked with herons on his palms, and taking the
      Stone of Tear and <i>Callandor</i>.  According to
      <a href="#Min">Min</a>&rsquo;s viewings, Rand is destined to fall in love
      with three women, one of which is Min, and the other of which is
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>.  The third is unknown to Min, and Rand
      as well.  Rand is fated to face the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>
      himself in Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don, the Last Battle.  He is quite
      tall, as tall as most Aiel men.  Rand fights the Shadow along with
      his childhood friends, <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a> and
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>, who are also <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i>,
      but much weaker.  Rand is also very good friends with fellow Emond&rsquo;s
      Fielder <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al&rsquo;Vere</a>&mdash;Rand and
      Egwene were expected to marry by everyone in the village including
      themselves, but they realized that their feelings for each other were
      more like siblings than like spouses.  Rand is the destiny of the
      entire world&mdash;should he die, the hope for the world would most
      likely die with him.

  <li><a class="name" id="Faolain">Faolain Orande</a>,
      p. 17 (5)&mdash;One
      of the Accepted.  She has dark curly hair, dark skin, and a round face.
      She meets <a href="#Min">Min</a> when she comes to the White Tower to
      give <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>&rsquo;s message to the
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>.  She has a dislike for wilders.
  <li><a class="name" id="Ananda">Ananda</a>,
      p. 18 (6)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Yellow Ajah.
      She is slender, and has black hair to her waist.
      <a href="#Min">Min</a> has a viewing of her indicating that she will die
      on the same day as many other Aes Sedai and Warders are killed or
      injured.
  <li><a class="name" id="Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>,
      p. 19 (7)&mdash;Essentially the secretary to the
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>.
      The Keeper is traditionally from the same Ajah from which the Amyrlin
      was raised.  The office is currently occupied by
      <a href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</a> of the Blue Ajah.

  <li><a class="name" id="Sheriam">Sheriam Bayanar</a>,
      p. 20 (7)&mdash;<a href="#Novices">Mistress of Novices</a>
      in the White Tower; an Aes Sedai of the
      Blue Ajah.  <a href="#Min">Min</a> has a viewing of her indicating that
      she will be hurt sometime in the future (although she cannot say when).
      Sheriam has long been a symbol of the Tower, at least in the eyes of
      those who come to study there&mdash;she keeps a strict but not brutal
      discipline and makes sure that her students know their place around her.
      Her study is famous in the Tower, both as a place of sanctuary when the
      stress of novice (or Accepted) life becomes too great to bear alone and
      as a place of punishment when an initiate steps out of line.
  <li><a class="name" id="Novices">Mistress of Novices</a>,
      p. 20 (7)&mdash;Aes Sedai in charge of novice training in the White Tower.
      She serves as both a disciplinarian and a shoulder to cry on for girls
      who need either.  The current Mistress of Novices is
      <a href="#Sheriam">Sheriam Bayanar</a> of the Blue Ajah.
      <i>See also</i>
      <a href="#Sheriam">Bayanar, Sheriam</a>.
  <li><a class="name" id="Sahra">Sahra Covenry</a>,
      p. 21 (8)&mdash;Black-haired novice, perhaps 15 or 16, who escorts
      <a href="#Min">Min</a> to the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>&rsquo;s
      study.  On the way, the two ran into <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>, who was
      on his way out of the Amyrlin&rsquo;s study, and Sahra heard nothing of the
      conversation that Min and Gawyn had due to her going
      &ldquo;calf-eyed&rdquo; over him.
  <li><a class="name" id="Gawyn">Gawyn Trakand</a>,
      p. 22 (9)&mdash;Son of <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a> of Andor, brother of
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> and half-brother of
      <a href="#Galad">Galad</a>.  He will become First Prince of the Sword
      when his sister becomes Queen.  He is in Tar Valon training with the
      Warders, as all sons of Andoran queens must do.  Gawyn has feelings for
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al&rsquo;Vere</a>, and she returns them, but he
      refuses to express his interests because Galad has a crush on Egwene
      as well.  His sign is a white boar.

      <a href="#Morgase">Trakand, Morgase</a>.
  <li><a class="name" id="Morgase">Morgase Trakand</a>,
      p. 22 (9)&mdash;By the Grace of the Light, Queen of Andor, Defender of the
      Realm, Protector of the People, High Seat of House Trakand, and mother of
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> and <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>.  She trained in the White
      Tower, as all Queens of Andor have, but she was too weak in the One Power
      to do anything worthwhile with the knowledge she learned there.
      She dismissed her Aes Sedai advisor, <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a>, after her
      daughter was spirited out of the Tower by <a href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</a>,
      and her new advisor, <a href="#Gaebril">Gaebril</a>, seems to be plotting to
      supplant her, or at least control her to the point where he rules Andor
      in truth if not in name.

      <a href="#Gawyn">Trakand, Gawyn</a>.
  <li><a class="name" id="Egwene">Egwene al&rsquo;Vere</a>,
      p. 22 (9)&mdash;A
      young woman from Emond&rsquo;s Field, now one of the Accepted.  She has
      considerable potential with the One Power, and will most likely be one
      of the strongest Aes Sedai in over a thousand years.  It is also thought
      that she may be the first Dreamer in the Tower in almost 500 years.
      Egwene is good friends with <a href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</a>, the
      Daughter-Heir of Andor, and is also a childhood friend of
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a>, the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.
      In fact, Rand and Egwene were all but Promised in their
      youth, but both of them feel an almost sibling-like love for each other
      now: they know that they cannot get married, and do not really want to
      (though they have yet to reveal these sentiments to each other).
      Egwene is the love interest of both of Elayne&rsquo;s brothers,
      <a href="#Galad">Galad</a> and
      <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>&mdash;she is flattered by Galad&rsquo;s attentions,
      but she does not return them; she does find Gawyn to her liking,
      however.  Egwene, along with Elayne and <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>, is one of
      the only people <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> trusts in the Tower:
      Siuan is convinced through their actions to date that they cannot
      possibly be Darkfriends.  She sent them on a dangerous mission:  spring
      the obvious trap the Black Ajah had set for them, and see if they can
      catch them in the process.
      Egwene is currently in the Stone of Tear, following the aftermath of the
      battle with <a href="#Belal">Be&rsquo;lal</a> and the taking of the Stone.

      <a href="#Gawyn">Trakand, Gawyn</a>.
  <li><a class="name" id="Elayne">Elayne Trakand</a>,
      p. 22 (9)&mdash;The <a href="#DH">Daughter-Heir of Andor</a>, the only daughter of
      <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a> and her late husband
      <a href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</a>.
      She is sister to <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a> and
      half-sister to <a href="#Galad">Galad</a>.  Elayne is now one of the
      Accepted, and has considerable potential in the One Power; she may become
      stronger than any living Aes Sedai save her two friends,
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al&rsquo;Vere</a> and
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara</a>.
      Elayne, along with Egwene and Nynaeve, is one of
      the only people <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> trusts in the Tower:
      Siuan is convinced through their actions to date that they cannot
      possibly be Darkfriends.
      She did not, however, send Elayne on the mission she gave the other two
      so as not to anger Morgase any more than she already had.
      Elayne still chose, of her own volition, to accompany her friends on
      their dangerous mission:  spring the obvious trap the Black Ajah had set
      for them, and see if they can catch them in the process.
      Elayne is currently in the Stone of Tear, following the aftermath of the
      battle with <a href="#Belal">Be&rsquo;lal</a> and the taking of the Stone.
      Her sign is a golden lily.

  <li><a class="name" id="Nynaeve">Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara</a>,
      p. 22 (9)&mdash;A young woman from Emond&rsquo;s Field, now one of the Accepted.  She
      has exceptional potential, and will most likely be the most powerful Aes
      Sedai since the Age of Legends.  However, Nynaeve&rsquo;s channeling is
      obstructed due to the fact that she had to learn to control her ability
      herself without really knowing what she was controlling: she is a
      wilder.  She can only touch the True Source when she is extremely angry
      (thereby letting her guard down and circumventing her block).
      Along with <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> and <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>,
      Nynaeve is one of three people <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> trusts
      in the Tower; Siuan is convinced through their actions to date that they
      cannot possibly be Darkfriends.
      She sent them on a dangerous mission:
      spring the obvious trap the Black Ajah had set for them,
      and see if they can catch them in the process.
      Nynaeve has developed feelings for <a href="#Lan">Lan Mandragoran</a>,
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>&rsquo;s Warder, and he shares those feelings
      despite his insistence that it is inappropriate and dangerous to act on
      them.  Nynaeve blames Moiraine herself for disrupting her village&rsquo;s life
      and endangering the lives of the four people she spirited away when the
      Trollocs attacked Emond&rsquo;s Field.  She wishes to learn how to control her
      ability so she can get even&mdash;to put Moiraine in her place, as it
      were&mdash;and to study and perfect the art of Healing.
      She is currently in the Stone of Tear, following the aftermath of the
      battle with <a href="#Belal">Be&rsquo;lal</a> and the taking of the Stone.

  <li><a class="name" id="Verin">Verin Mathwin</a>,
      p. 22 (9)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Brown Ajah.  She accompanied <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>,
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>, <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>, and

      first ruler of any kind in recent memory, to actually have enough

      <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase of Andor</a>, a position she sought
      due to her Foretelling about the importance of the Royal Family of
      Andor to the Last Battle.  Elaida is the only Aes Sedai alive to have any
      real strength in the Fortelling&mdash;the last Aes Sedai to actually have
      regular Foretellings was <a href="#Gitara">Gitara Moroso</a>,
      now dead over twenty years.  Elaida keeps her own agenda,
      and is very suspicious (as all Reds are) of Blue Ajah activities,
      especially those of <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> and
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a> (Elaida still considers the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin</a> to be
      of the Blue Ajah, not of &ldquo;all Ajahs and none&rdquo;).
      Elaida&rsquo;s Foretelling about the importance of the Andoran Royal Family
      occurred while she was still one of the Accepted, prior to the Third War
      of Andoran Succession, after which Morgase took the throne.  Thus, her

      to tell Tigraine that she must become a Maiden
      of the Spear, and tell Luc (Tigraine&rsquo;s brother) that
      his fame (or fate) lay in the Blight.  Both the Daughter-Heir and future

      p. 38 (23)&mdash;A
      young man from Emond&rsquo;s Field.  He is <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i>.  When he and
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> got separated from the rest of the group
      while fleeing the Trollocs on Winternight, Perrin met a man named
      <a href="#Elyas">Elyas Machera</a>.  Elyas, a former Warder who found he
      could talk to wolves, helped Perrin discover the same ability in himself.
      Perrin&rsquo;s eyes are now yellow, just like the wolves&rsquo; eyes, and he can
      enter what he calls the Wolf Dream (known to most as
      <i>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</i>, the World of Dreams) with them.
      Perrin is a childhood friend of fellow <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i>
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a> and <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>.
      On the way to Tear, Perrin encountered a young woman by the name of
      <a href="#Zarine">Zarine Bashere</a>, a Hunter for the Horn who
      took the name of <a href="#Faile">Faile</a> (which means
      &ldquo;Falcon&rdquo; in the Old Tongue) as a more appropriate name for
      a hunter for the horn.  The two have grown to love each other.
      Perrin is a very large man&mdash;he was always a big person,
      which caused him to be very cautious since he found as a child that he
      could easily hurt other children if his temper got out of hand.
      His size helped considerably when helping
      <a href="#Luhhan">Master Luhhan</a> on his forge, but sometimes gives
      others the impression that he is slow and stupid.

      Along with his good friends, <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a> and
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>, he left home to escape the Trolloc
      attack on Winternight.  On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger
      from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which
      he carried with him for a long time.  He was separated from the dagger
      by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory
      sequence, gaps which he desperately wants to fill.  Mat&rsquo;s
      <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i> qualities manifest themselves particularly well with
      random events, such as dice games&mdash;he almost never loses a toss of
      the dice, even if the dice are weighted.  He has four sisters, including
      <a href="#Eldrin">Eldrin</a> and <a href="#Bode">Bodewhin</a>, who are
      16 and 17, respectively.  His father <a href="#Abell">Abell</a> is one
      of the best archers in the Two Rivers, possibly in the world.  Mat has
      gotten in the habit of carrying concealed knives under his clothes in
      case he is attacked&mdash;his collection would surprise anyone.
      Mat promised <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> he would carry a letter for
      her to her mother in Caemlyn in exchange for safe passage out of Tar
      Valon.  While in the Palace, he overheard a conversation between two

      <a href="#Gaebril">Gaebril</a>, <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a>&rsquo;s new

      from Gaebril&rsquo;s men.
      He saved all three women from the Black Ajah&rsquo;s captivity in the Stone,

      &ldquo;emotional walls&rdquo; that he has been building for years.
      His country, Malkier, was overrun by Trollocs shortly after he was born,
      and is now corrupted by the Great Blight.  Lan, the last of his people,
      then proceeded to fight a one-man war against the Shadow by killing
      Shadowspawn in the Blight.  He fought Aiel during the Aiel War,
      and achieved Blademaster status.  He was eventually bonded by Moiraine,

      Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan&rsquo;s emotional walls and break them
      down without him even knowing they were there.  He loves her very much,
      whether he admits it openly or not, and Nynaeve, to her surprise (and
      Lan&rsquo;s), loves him in return.  His favorite colors on women are green,
      blue, and white&mdash;Nynaeve&rsquo;s wardrobe just happened to become rich in
      those colors once she found out.

      loved.  Due to his barely being trapped in the Bore, his sanity was not
      completely intact for the 3000 years since the Breaking of the World; he
      allowed others to believe that he was the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>,

      p. 477 (428)&mdash;Former
      peddler who came to Emond&rsquo;s Field frequently with news of the outside
      world.  The true purpose of his visits were to find a list of young men
      who might be the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>&mdash;he was
      collecting this information as a Darkfriend, passing it on to
      <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a> when he was able to narrow the list.
      He finally selected three possible:  <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a>,
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>, and <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>,
      who were born within weeks of one another during the Aiel War.  Fain was
      then given orders to follow the three men, and on the way went through
      Shadar Logoth, where he encountered the spirit of
      Mordeth.  Mordeth attempted to consume his soul and take over his
      body, but instead the two spirits merged, creating something more evil
      than either of them alone.  Fain eventually hooked up with the Children
      of the Light, and managed to become advisor to
      <a href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</a>,
      the Lord Captain Commander of the Children, using the name
      <a href="#Ordeith">Ordeith</a>.  Fain is a very dangerous man:  it is
      said, &ldquo;The look of the Eyeless (Myrddraal) is fear.&rdquo;
      However, Fades have the same feeling of fear looking at Fain as normal
      people have looking at Myrddraal.  Fain is likely the most dangerous
      creation in the world, with the possible exception of the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> himself.

      name herself, never giving another to the Aiel who met her.  It means,
      &ldquo;Woman who is Dedicated.&rdquo;  She abandoned a son she loved and
      a husband she did not because <a href="#Gitara">Gitara Moroso</a> told
      her disaster would strike if she did not become a Maiden of the Spear.
      After a year she was adopted into the Chumai sept of the Taardad Aiel.
      Shaiel became pregnant during the Aiel War, and gave birth to a son,
      after which she died. She had golden hair.

  <li><a class="name" id="Janduin">Janduin</a>,
      p. 563 (508)&mdash;<a href="#Rand">Rand</a>&rsquo;s biological father, an Aiel of the
      Iron Mountain sept of the Taardad Aiel.  He was the youngest clan
      chief of the Taardad Aiel in memory. <a href="#Seana">Seana</a> says he
      &ldquo;had a way about him, a power&rdquo;; this suggests that he may have been
      <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i>, though whether that is actually the case is not known.
      He ended the blood feud between the Taardad and Nakai clans after over
      200 years of fighting, and then allied not only with the Nakai, but with
      the Reyn Aiel as well (who were not much better than blood enemies before
      the alliance was made).  He almost ended the blood feud between the
      Shaarad and Goshien clans (which still persists today, causing trouble
      for <a href="#Chiad">Chiad</a> and <a href="#Gaul">Gaul</a>), and would have if
      <a href="#Laman">King Laman</a> would not have cut down
      <i><a href="#Avendo">Avendoraldera</a></i>.  He loved <a href="#Shaiel">Shaiel</a>,
      to the point where he could not refuse to let her fight in the Aiel War
      despite being with child.  It was Janduin himself who led the four
      clans&mdash;Taardad, Nakai, Reyn, and Shaarad&mdash;across the Spine of
      the World to punish Laman for his Sin, throwing the entire world into war
      and allowing Prophecy to be fulfilled. It is said he was killed leading
      warriors in the Blight by a man who looked so much like Shaiel that he
      was unable to raise his spear to defend himself.
      <!--i>Editor&rsquo;s note:  It is beyond reasonable doubt that
      Janduin&rsquo;s killer was Luc Mantear, Shaiel&rsquo;s brother,
      who disappeared into the Blight at the behest of <a href="#Gitara">Gitara</a>
      Sedai.</i-->

      tried to get away, so Egeanin snapped the <i>a&rsquo;dam</i> she was carrying

      fleeing (since Bethamin supposedly cannot channel, the <i>a&rsquo;dam</i>
      should have no other effect than throwing a metal ring around her head).
      Much to Egeanin&rsquo;s and Bethamin&rsquo;s surprise, the <i>a&rsquo;dam</i> held
      Bethamin just as well as it held the <i>damane</i> for whom it was
      intended. This suggests that Bethamin&mdash;and perhaps all
      <i>sul&rsquo;dam</i>&mdash;can channel, which goes against everything Egeanin
      has ever been taught.

      who devised the Toman Calendar, which was adopted approximately two

      until the Trolloc Wars.  The Calendar recorded years After the Breaking,

      <a href="#Creator">Creator</a> in every way.  At the moment of Creation,
      the Dark One was imprisoned by the Creator at Shayol Ghul.
      This prison kept the Dark One from touching the world until it was bored
      into by humans during the Age of Legends.  This hole, called the Bore,
      allowed the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new
      outbreaks of war, treachery, violence, and crime.  The attempt to free
      the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the
      War of Power by some), during which a number of important leaders
      forsook the Light and gave their lives to the Dark One; these people
      are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of the most powerful Aes
      Sedai of the Age of Legends.  The War of the Shadow did not end until
      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, the
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>, and his Hundred Companions Traveled to
      Shayol Ghul and re-sealed the Dark One back into his prison.
      At the moment of sealing, Shai&rsquo;tan lashed out at those sealing the
      prison, driving them insane and tainting <i>saidin</i> itself,
      the male half of the True Source, dooming all male Aes Sedai to insanity
      as well and starting the Time of Madness.  These seals are weakening
      now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the Dark One is once
      again able to exert influence on the world.
