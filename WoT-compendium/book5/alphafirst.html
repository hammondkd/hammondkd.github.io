  <li><i><a class="name" id="Aan">Aan&rsquo;allein</a></i>,
      p. 281 (200)&mdash;What the Aiel call <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>.  It means &ldquo;One Man&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;Man Who Is an Entire People,&rdquo; in the Old Tongue.  It refers to his
      status as the last surviving Malkieri.
      <i>See</i>
      <a href="#Lan">Mandragoran, Lan</a>.
  <li><a class="name" id="Abelle">Abelle Pendar</a>,
      p. 354 (251)&mdash;Andoran lord, leader of a strong House that supported
      <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a> during the Succession.  Morgase exiled him
      from Caemlyn as per <a href="#Gaebril">Gaebril</a>&rsquo;s suggestion.
  <li><a class="name" id="Adelin">Adelin</a>,
      p. 107 (78)&mdash;One of the Maidens on guard at <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>&rsquo;s door, and

      <a href="#Leane">Leane</a>, and <a href="#Logain">Logain</a> slept in on
      their journey through the countryside.  He found them, and in the chaos
      his lantern fell into the hay and the barn burned to the ground.  Nem
      would just as soon have hanged them, had the local lord,
      <a href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</a>, not shown up at that moment.

      <a href="#Maigan">Nem, Maigan</a>.
  <li><a class="name" id="Aeldene">Aeldene Stonebridge</a>,
      p. 241 (172)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah. She replaced <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a> as
      as master of the Blue Ajah&rsquo;s spy network when Siuan was raised
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin</a> (or perhaps replaced the woman who replaced
      Siuan, or&hellip;you get the idea).
  <li><a class="name" id="Aemlyn">Aemlyn Carand</a>,
      p. 354 (251)&mdash;Andoran lady, leader of a strong House that supported
      <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a> during the Succession.  Morgase exiled
      her from Caemlyn as per <a href="#Gaebril">Gaebril</a>&rsquo;s suggestion.
  <li><a class="name" id="Aemon">Aemon al Caar al Thorin</a>,
      p. 861 (610)&mdash;King of Manetheren during the Trolloc
      Wars.  He died trying to save his city, and the city died shortly
      thereafter.  The site of this battle was called Aemon&rsquo;s Field, which is
      where the present-day city of Emond&rsquo;s Field is located.  Aemon&rsquo;s last
      names still exist in Emond&rsquo;s Field:  the al&rsquo;Caars and the al&rsquo;Thors still
      live there.
  <li><a class="name">Aerin</a>,
      p. (293)&mdash;Misspelling of
      <a href="#Aeron">Aeron</a>, one of the Aiel Wise Ones.  <i>This mistake
      was corrected in later editions of the books.</i>
      <i>See</i>
      <a href="#Aeron">Aeron</a>.
  <li><a class="name" id="Aeron">Aeron</a>,
      p. 443&mdash;One of the Aiel Wise Ones.
      She is of the Black Water sept of the Nakai Aiel.
  <li><a class="name" id="Agelmar">Agelmar Jagad</a>,
      p. 469 (333)&mdash;Lord of Fal Dara, and commander of the King&rsquo;s army in
      Shienar.  He is one of the best military commanders in the World, in
      such company as <a href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</a>,
      <a href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</a>, <a href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</a>,
      and <a href="#Rodel">Rodel Ituralde</a>.
  <li><a class="name" id="Aginor">Aginor</a>,
      p. 976 (692)&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  He was the second one to be released from the
      sealing on the Bore.  He was trapped close to the surface of the Bore,
      so he was not shielded from the passing of time very effectively; he
      emerged as a <em>very</em> old man, so old that his face was so wrinkled
      one could barely make out his features anymore.  He was killed by
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> at the Eye of the World.
  <li><a class="name" id="Neres">Agni Neres</a>,
      p. 788 (559)&mdash;Tall, bony captain of <i>Riverserpent</i>, the boat
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> and <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> take from
      Ghealdan to Salidar.  He has a narrow face, and his ears stick out.
  <li><a class="name" id="Ailron">King Ailron</a>,
      p. 208 (148)&mdash;King of
      Amadicia.  He is not as strong as most kings due to the control of the
      Children of the Light.

      <a href="#Niall">Niall, Pedron</a>.
  <li><a class="name" id="Aldieb">Aldieb</a>,

  <li><a class="name" id="Aleshin">Lord Aleshin</a>,
      p. 620 (439)&mdash;Man who thanked <a href="#Masema">Masema</a> profusely for his mercy, just
      as <a href="#Baelome">Lady Baelome</a> did, when he named
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> in Masema&rsquo;s presence.
  <li><a class="name" id="Alfara">Mistress Alfara</a>,
      p. 256 (183)&mdash;Innkeeper of the Bellon Ford Inn in Amadicia.
  <li><a class="name" id="Alliandre">Alliandre Maritha Kigarin</a>,
      p. 22 (19)&mdash;Blessed of the Light, Queen of Ghealdan.
      She gives her jewelry to <a href="#Masema">Masema</a> so he does not ask
      for anything more than that from her.  She is the fourth person to sit
      on the throne in six months.

      <a href="#Johanin">Johanin</a>;
      <a href="#Teresia">Teresia</a>.
  <li><a class="name" id="Alteima">High Lady Alteima</a>,
      p. 67 (49)&mdash;High Lady of Tear with black hair.  She knows how pretty she is
      and how to use that fact to get what she wants from men.  She comes to
      see <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a> after fleeing Tear in hope that the Queen
      will be able to restore her to some of her influence she held in Tear in
      her new home, Caemlyn.  She tried to poison her husband,
      <a href="#Tedosian">Tedosian</a>, but did not succeed in killing him.
      <i>See also</i>
      <a href="#Tedosian">Tedosian</a>.
  <li><a class="name" id="Aludra">Aludra</a>,
      p. 330 (234)&mdash;Slender
      woman who does fireworks for <a href="#Luca">Luca</a>&rsquo;s menagerie.  She
      was cast out of the Illuminators&rsquo; Guild because she was blamed for
      spoiling the performace for
      <a href="#Galldrian">King Galldrian</a> of Cairhien.  The problem was
      actually Tammuz&rsquo;s fault (or so they thought),
      but she was a more convenient target.
      The mishap for Galldrian was actually caused by
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a>.
      <i>See also</i>
      <a href="#Galldrian">Riatin, Galldrian</a>.
  <li><a class="name" id="Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</a>,
      p. 14&mdash;Aes Sedai of the White Ajah.  Typical
      of most Whites, she has a very cool, collected personality.  She serves
      as <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a> under
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a>, despite being of a different Ajah than
      Elaida was raised from.  Elaida was all but forced to choose Alviarin in
      order to gain the support of the White Ajah when bringing charges against
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a>.  Without Alviarin as Keeper, the Sitters for the White
      Ajah would most likely have been divided over whether to depose Siuan,
      and only the Red would be behind Elaida.  This would most likely have
      led to the stilling of Elaida and possibly even the dismantling of the
      Red Ajah.
      <i>See also</i>
      <a href="#Elaida">a&rsquo;Roihan, Elaida do Avriny</a>;
      <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>.
  <li><a class="name" id="Amaena">Amaena</a>,
      p. 42 (33)&mdash;Name that <a href="#Leane">Leane</a> adopts while traveling to hide her
      true identity.
      <i>See</i>
      <a href="#Leane">Sharif, Leane</a>.
  <li><a class="name" id="Amathera">Amathera Aelfdene Casmir Lounault</a>,
      p. 16 (15)&mdash;The Panarch of Tarabon.  She has vanished, allegedly at
      Aes Sedai hands, according to <a href="#Evanellein">Evanellein</a>.  In
      reality, Amathera was being held prisoner by sisters of the Black Ajah
      under <a href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</a> and was rescued by
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> and <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>.  They
      had her keep a low profile for several days so as not to be hurt by the
      mob outside the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace: it is not all that far from
      &ldquo;The Panarch is dead!&rdquo; to &ldquo;Death to the Panarch!&rdquo;
  <li><a class="name" id="Amellia">Amellia Arene</a>,
      p. 335 (238)&mdash;<a href="#Arene">Jorin</a>&rsquo;s wife. Like her husband, she is a
      Darkfriend.
      <i>See also</i>
      <a href="#Arene">Arene, Jorin</a>.
  <li><a class="name" id="Gueyam">Amondrid Gueyam</a>,
      p. 729 (518)&mdash;Bald, large High Lord of Tear who comes with <a href="#Meilan">Meilan</a>
      to see <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>.
  <li><a class="name" id="Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>,
      p. 13&mdash;Leader of the Aes Sedai, appointed for life by the Hall of the
      Tower.  She in theory holds supreme power amongst the sisters, and leads
      the Hall of the Tower at its meetings.  Kings and queens of nations
      strong and weak will obey a summons from the Amyrlin, even if they spend
      their entire trip figuring out how they will put a knife in her back
      while there.  The Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in
      the Power and in her character.  The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be
      unanimous, as must the vote to depose one.  Once chosen, the Amyrlin is
      said to be &ldquo;of all Ajahs and none&rdquo;&mdash;all previous
      affiliations with Ajah are ignored (at least in theory).  The Ajahs have
      gotten fairly equal numbers of Amyrlins raised from them, with two
      exceptions:  no Amyrlin had been raised from the Red Ajah since
      <a href="#Bonwhin">Bonwhwin Meraighdin</a>, who was deposed and stilled
      for nearly breaking the Tower in <a href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a>&rsquo;s
      day, until <a href="#Elaida">Elaida a&rsquo;Roihan</a>, the current Amyrlin
      Seat in Tar Valon; the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of
      Amyrlins from its ranks&mdash;four of the last five Amyrlins (not
      counting Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah.  These two exceptions to
      the mean number of Amyrlins from one&rsquo;s Ajah have only added to the
      friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years.  The Amyrlin has
      a secretary of sorts, the <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>,
      who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the Amyrlin was
      raised from.  The office was held by <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>,
      raised from the Blue Ajah, until she was deposed for her involvement with
      events surrounding the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.  Her
      successor was the leader of the coup,
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a&rsquo;Roihan</a>,
      raised from the Red Ajah.

  <li><a class="name" id="Amys">Amys</a>,
      p. 124 (89)&mdash;Wise One
      of the Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel.
      <a href="#Rhuarc">Rhuarc</a>&rsquo;s wife (one of two).  She is one of the
      Wise Ones that is training <a href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</a> and

  <li><a class="name" id="Anaiya">Anaiya</a>,
      p. 447 (317)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah with blunt features.  She is described
      as &ldquo;motherly,&rdquo; and was good friends with <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>.  She, like
      all other Blues, fled Tar Valon when <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a> was raised
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin</a>.
  <li><a class="name" id="Andaya">Andaya Forae</a>,
      p. 18 (16)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Gray Ajah.  A thin, birdlike woman, she is
      outwardly timid despite Aes Sedai agelessness.  This makes her seem
      unlikely to be a good mediator, but she is in fact one of the best of
      them. She grew up in Tarabon, and retains a bit of a Taraboner
      accent.

  <li><a class="name" id="Andaya2">Andaya Murasaka</a>,
      p. 769 (546)&mdash;A member of <a href="#Luca">Valan Luca</a>&rsquo;s menagerie.  <i>Not to

      <a href="#Aril">Corl, Aril ni Nethin</a>.
  <li><a class="name" id="Andric">King Andric</a>,
      p. 196 (141)&mdash;King of Tarabon.  Rumor told the Whitecloaks that he had been
      supplanted.
  <li><a class="name" id="Anselan">Anselan</a>,
      p. 418 (297)&mdash;Hero of
      Legend who appears in <i>The Flame, the Blade, and the
      Heart</i>, a book <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> is reading.  He was a
      Warder chosen by the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a> of the time for
      <a href="#Barashelle">Barashelle</a>.  Barashelle had bonded a Warder as
      an Accepted; this was strictly forbidden, even though she was to be
      raised to the shawl the next day.  She bonded him then to make sure that
      another Accepted, who was being raised one day earlier than she, did not
      bond him first.  The Amyrlin made her transfer his bond to another
      woman, and forced her to bond Anselan.  Anselan was cold to her, and she
      spent most of her life trying to make him see her with respect.

  <li><a class="name" id="Aracome">High Lord Aracome</a>,
      p. 729 (518)&mdash;Gray, slender High Lord of Tear with a long-smoldering temper.
      He comes with <a href="#Meilan">Meilan</a> and other High Lords to see
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> after the victory over the Shaido.
  <li><a class="name" id="Arathelle">Arathelle Renshar</a>,
      p. 354 (251)&mdash;Andoran lady, leader of a strong House that supported
      <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a> during the Succession.  Morgase exiled
      her from Caemlyn as per <a href="#Gaebril">Gaebril</a>&rsquo;s suggestion.
  <li><a class="name" id="Areina">Areina Nermasiv</a>,
      p. 802 (569)&mdash;A
      Ghealdanin refugee with steady blue eyes and a bruised face.  All she
      owns are the clothes she wears.  She went to Illian to stop her younger
      brother <a href="#Gwil">Gwil</a> from swearing the oath of a Hunter of
      the Horn; she was too late, and ended up swearing the oaths herself.
      She still searches for him.  She maintains a free tongue, saying exactly
      what is on her mind.

      <a href="#Ander">Ander</a>&rsquo;s wife.  Her two children were kidnapped as
      alleged <i>gai&rsquo;shain</i> by the Shaido.  Although by Aiel custom those
      who do not follow <i>ji&rsquo;e&rsquo;toh</i> cannot be taken <i>gai&rsquo;shain</i>, they
      were taken just the same.

  <li><a class="name" id="Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a>,
      p. 19 (17)&mdash;Name by which <a href="#Artur">Artur Paendrag Tanreall</a>
      was known by after his rise to power.
      <i>See</i>
      <a href="#Artur">Paendrag Tanreall, Artur</a>.
  <li><a class="name" id="Artur">Artur Paendrag Tanreall</a>,
      p. 394 (279)&mdash;Young king who rose up out of the chaos surrounding the
      campaigns of the false <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>
      <a href="#Guaire">Guaire Amalasan</a>.  He dismantled Amalasan&rsquo;s armies
      despite having smaller forces to begin with, and created an empire that
      contained most of the known world.  He was <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i>, possibly the
      most strongly so in history with the exception of
      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a> and
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a>.  <i>Note:  it
      is not known exactly how strongly </i>ta&rsquo;veren<i> Hawkwing was, and it
      is difficult to judge the strength of <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a> and
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a> because of their proximity to Rand,
      but it is likely he was stronger than they are, too.</i>  Hawkwing even
      went as far as sending armies across the Aryth Ocean under his son
      Luthair; contact with these armies was lost at
      Hawkwing&rsquo;s death, but their descendants have returned from across the
      ocean to reclaim the land.  They are known as the Seanchan.  His death
      also set off the War of the Hundred Years.  Hawkwing is one of the
      heroes bound to the Horn of Valere; he led them when Mat sounded the
      Horn at Falme.

  <li><a class="name" id="Marne">Arymilla Marne</a>,
      p. 347 (247)&mdash;One of the few people in the Palace that
      <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a> still recognizes.  The brown-eyed noble
      was forbidden to be on Palace grounds for opposing Morgase during the
      Succession until <a href="#Gaebril">Gaebril</a> Compelled <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a> to
      rescind the order.
  <li><a class="name" id="Asmodean">Asmodean</a>,
      p. 33 (26)&mdash;One of the Forsaken.  His real name was
      <a href="#Joar">Joar Addam Nesossin</a>.
      After a battle with <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> in Rhuidean
      that nearly destroyed the city, Rand severed Asmodean&rsquo;s bonds to the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>.  Rand then coerced him to teach him how to
      channel more effectively and safely. He was born in Shorelle, a city on
      a coastline. To allow him to teach Rand but not be strong enough to
      confront him again, Lanfear made a shield for Asmodean that constricted

      Sin&mdash;the Aiel now refer to all Cairhienin as

      pretext to pull down an Amyrlin raised from the Blue Ajah.

      She is one of the strongest in the One Power among the Aes Sedai alive.
      Elaida was the advisor to <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a>
      of Andor prior to her dismissal after <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>&rsquo;s
      dissappearance, after which she led the coup that deposed
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> and <a href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</a>.
      She sometimes has the Foretelling, one of the last living Aes Sedai with
      any significant strength with the Talent; in fact, one of her first
      Foretellings concerned the importance of the Royal Family of Andor in the
      fight against the Shadow.  She had this Foretelling while she was still
      one of the Accepted, during the time after <a href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</a>
      disappeared and threw Andor into its third war of Succession&mdash;Elaida
      attached herself to Morgase as soon as it became apparent that she would
      be the one who would take the Throne. Elaida is very strong in the One
      Power&mdash;only Siuan (before she was stilled), <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>,
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>, Elayne, <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>, and a few others are
      stronger.  As a Red, Elaida is suspicious of all sisters of the Brown,
      Green, and Yellow Ajahs, and <i>hates</i> members of the Blue.  She does
      not believe she will be able to trust a Blue ever again, and the stole
      she wears as Amyrlin Seat lacks a blue stripe. Elaida was not powerful
      enough to demand a <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a> from
      her own Ajah, instead elevating <a href="#Alviarin">Alviarin</a>, of the White Ajah,

      She seems completely besotted with him, at least to the outside observer.
      Gaebril arrived in Caemlyn just as riots sprang up throughout the city,
      and he joined and led one of the factions.  His faction restored order in
      the city, and upon Morgase&rsquo;s return from Tar Valon, he gave her her
      kingdom in one piece, as it was when she left.  Allegedly, she was so
      happy that he had done this that she sent <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a>, her
      Aes Sedai advisor, away and made Gaebril her advisor.  However, during

      him practice (shirtless) in the sword yard.  Galad has much skill with

      name.  He disappeared from Tar Valon during the violence that
      accompanied <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a>&rsquo;s deposition and joined
      <a href="#Valda">Eamon Valda</a>&rsquo;s band of the Children of the Light.
      Because of his sword skill, Galad was promoted to an official position
      very quickly, and now controls his own small band of men.  He says he
      became a Whitecloak because it &ldquo;felt right.&rdquo;  He is extremely

      <a href="#Galad">Galad</a> went to train with the Warders in the White
      Tower, as all sons of Andoran queens have for centuries, and both now
      possess considerable skill with the sword.  During the chaos that

      formed a band of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders
      except Galad, who are called the Younglings.  The Younglings fought back

      <a href="#Leane">Leane</a> from their imprisonment.  Gawyn himself
      killed Hammar and Coulin,
      the men in charge of teaching the sword and for his personal training,
      respectively, both of which are Blademasters&mdash;few Warders are as
      good as they were, and Gawyn managed to kill both of them.  Gawyn did
      not know which party to support&mdash;he believes that anyone who
      opposes Tower Law by trying to free Siuan and Leane is wrong, but at the
      same time he does not know all the facts surrounding the change in

  <li><a class="name" id="Laman">Laman Damodred</a>,
      p. 378 (267)&mdash;King of Cairhien twenty years ago.  His cutting of
      <i><a href="#Avendo">Avendoraldera</a></i> to make a throne unlike
      anything the world had ever seen precipitated the Aiel War.  The war
      continued for years until all nations united against the Aiel and even
      Tar Valon was threatened; the war finally ended when the Aiel killed
      Laman and took his sword.  Because of Laman&rsquo;s Pride, and his Sin, House
      Damodred lost the throne of Cairhien to House Riatin, and the city never
      again reached any of its former glory&mdash;but it also allowed Prophecy
      to be fulfilled: the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> was able to be
      born on the slopes of Dragonmount, born of a Maiden of the Spear but
      raised by the blood of the old nations.

      uncrowned king of Malkier, and Warder to
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>.  He is quite tall, and does not get
      very emotional&mdash;in fact, he has &ldquo;emotional walls&rdquo; that
      he has been building for years.  His country, Malkier, was overrun by
      Trollocs shortly after he was born, and is now corrupted by the Great
      Blight.  Lan, the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a one-man
      war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight.  He fought
      Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status.  He was
      eventually bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at least
      changed its style).  When Lan and Moiraine brought

      found that there was something which could throw his guard down, but he
      was the last to notice it:  love for Nynaeve.  As Moiraine put it,
      Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan&rsquo;s emotional walls and break them
      down without him even knowing they were there.  He loves her very much,
      whether he admits it openly or not, and Nynaeve, to her surprise and
      his, loves him in return.

      found that her life would take a different direction:  she could channel
      <i>saidar</i>, and would do so with or without teaching.  She became an

      they should not have been doing before marrying.  Kimry was 21 at the

  <li><a class="name" id="Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>,
      p. 33 (27)&mdash;The <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>, Breaker of the World.  He
      was perhaps the greatest man who ever lived, and the most powerful Aes
      Sedai in recorded history.  During the War of the Shadow, he lead the
      forces of the Light against the Forsaken, and led the final stroke which
      re-sealed the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> back into his prison.
      Unfortunately, during this stroke he was driven insane by the Dark One&rsquo;s
      touch, eventually killing his wife <a href="#Ilyena">Ilyena</a>, his
      children, and everyone he loved, as well as anyone who carried a drop of
      his blood.  For this act, people remember him with a new name:
      <a href="#Kinslayer">Kinslayer</a>.  After he had done this,
      <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a> gave him his sanity back long enough for him to
      realize what he had done; Lews Therin killed himself by drawing on
      <i>saidin</i> too heavily, causing a mountain to form on the spot where
      he stood.  This mountain is called Dragonmount, and is near the
      present-day city of Tar Valon.  It is unfortunate that the name of one
      of the greatest men to ever live is now synonymous with evil, for Lews
      Therin killed his family due to the Dark One&rsquo;s influence, but without
      Lews Therin there may not have been a world left in which to kill them.
      Lews Therin&rsquo;s voice sometimes speaks inside <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>&rsquo;s head,
      offering advice or sobbing over lost women, but is getting more and
      more vocal.

      of thirteen Aes Sedai who declared themselves Black Ajah and fled the
      White Tower, murdering guards and even sisters in the process.  Liandrin

      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>, he left home to escape the Trolloc
      attack on Winternight.  On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger
      from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which
      he carried with him for a long time.  He was separated from the dagger
      by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory
      sequence.  These gaps were filled and more when he passed through the
      twisted door to the land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three
      requests:  a foxhead medallion that protected him from women&rsquo;s
      channeling, a way out of the land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of
      past lifetimes that were the gaps in his memory.  Mat&rsquo;s <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i>
      qualities manifest themselves particularly well with random events, such
      as dice games&mdash;he almost never loses a toss of the dice, even if
      the dice are weighted.  He has found that battles are the ultimate form
      of gambling, and along with his newfound memories he can win almost
      every battle he fights quite decisively.  He has four sisters, including
      Eldrin and Bodewhin, who are 16
      and 17, respectively.  His father Abell is one of

      city and its inhabitants were so consumed by evil that the entire city is

      soul remained in Shadar Logoth for millenia&mdash;he could not leave the

      while the dagger tried to consume Mat&rsquo;s.  In Fain&rsquo;s case, the attempt to
      consume his soul was not completely successful&mdash;instead, the two

  <li><a class="name" id="Nynaeve">Nynaeve al&rsquo;Meara</a>,
      p. 98 (71)&mdash;A young woman from Emond&rsquo;s Field, formerly its Wisdom, now one of
      the Accepted.  She has exceptional potential in the One Power, and will
      most likely be the most powerful Aes Sedai since the Age of Legends.
      However, Nynaeve&rsquo;s channeling is obstructed due to the fact that she had
      to learn to control her ability herself without really knowing what she
      was controlling; she is a wilder.  She can only touch the True Source
      when she is extremely angry.  She went, along with
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> and <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>, to Tear
      to hunt down <a href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</a> and the rest of the sisters
      that left the Tower and declared themselves Black Ajah.  On the way she
      freed <a href="#Amathera">Amathera</a> from them, as well as defeating
      <a href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</a>.  Moghedien got free, and now hunts
      Nynaeve with a passion for revenge.  Nynaeve has strong feelings for
      <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>, feelings which he returns; she can hardly wait
      for the time when <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> releases him from his
      bond so she can have him to herself.  She wants to become Aes Sedai for
      the sole purpose of Healing people; she thinks the Tower meddles in the
      affairs of others far too much, but she does need it to learn the skills
      necessary to help others.  She is determined to find a way to Heal
      everything short of death&mdash;she will not be convinced that anything
      short of that cannot be Healed, including stilling, gentling, and the
      wound on <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>&rsquo;s side.

      A Darkfriend, he was given orders to locate the

      Emond&rsquo;s Field.  While persuing them, he encountered the spirit of
      <a href="#Mordeth">Mordeth</a> in Aridhol, now called Shadar Logoth.  Mordeth
      attempted to consume Fain&rsquo;s soul, but instead the two souls merged,
      producing something more evil than either of them alone.  Fain no longer
      takes his orders from the Shadow; he has his own evil agenda.  It is
      said, &ldquo;The look of the Eyeless is fear,&rdquo; from observing that a
      Myrddraal&rsquo;s look causes fear in the hearts of men.  Fain&rsquo;s look has that
      effect on Myrddraal&mdash;Fades feel the same fear of Fain as men feel
      from a Fade.  <i>Machin Shin</i>, the Black Wind of
      the Ways which is perfectly alright with consuming Trollocs alive,
      did not consume Fain&rsquo;s soul, instead welcoming him as an old friend.
      Fain is also called <a href="#Ordeith">Ordeith</a>, a name he adopted to become a
      Whitecloak officer.  He is perhaps the most evil and dangerous man
      alive.

      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> got separated from the rest of the group
      while fleeing the Trollocs on Winternight, Perrin met a man named
      Elyas Machera.  Elyas, a former Warder who found he
      could talk to wolves, helped Perrin discover the same ability in himself.
      Perrin&rsquo;s eyes are now yellow, just like the wolves&rsquo; eyes, and he can
      enter what he calls the Wolf Dream (known to most as
      <i>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</i>, the World of Dreams) with them.  Perrin is a
      childhood friend of fellow <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i>
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a> and <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>.  On
      the way to Tear, Perrin encountered a young woman by the name of
      <a href="#Zarine">Zarine Bashere</a>, a Hunter for the Horn who
      took the name of <a href="#Faile">Faile</a> (which means &ldquo;Falcon&rdquo; in the
      Old Tongue) as a more appropriate name for a Hunter for the Horn.  The
      two are now married.  Perrin is a very large man&mdash;he was
      always a big person, which caused him to be very cautious since he found
      as a child that he could easily hurt other children if his temper got
      out of hand.  His size helps considerably when helping
      Master Luhhan on his forge, but sometimes gives
      others the impression that he is slow and stupid.  He is currently in
      the Two Rivers, helping to rebuild the area after the series of Trolloc
      attacks.

      p. 973 (690)&mdash;The Dark One, source of all evil, complete opposite of the
      <a href="#Creator">Creator</a> in every way.  At the moment of Creation,
      the Dark One was imprisoned by the Creator at Shayol Ghul.
      This prison kept the Dark One from touching the world until it was bored
      into by humans during the Age of Legends.  This hole, called the Bore,
      allowed the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new
      outbreaks of war, treachery, violence, and crime.  The attempt to free
      the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the
      War of Power by some, especially those on the Shadow&rsquo;s side), during
      which a number of important leaders forsook the Light and gave their
      lives to the Dark One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and
      were 13 of the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  The War
      of the Shadow did not end until <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>,
      the Dragon, and his Hundred Companions Traveled to Shayol Ghul and
      re-sealed the Dark One back into his prison.  At the moment of sealing,
      Shai&rsquo;tan lashed out at those sealing the prison, driving them insane and
      tainting <i>saidin</i> itself, the male half of the True Source, dooming
      all male Aes Sedai to madness as well and starting the Time of Madness.
      These seals are weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and
      the Dark One is once again able to exert influence on the world.  Only
      three of them still hold, as far as is known, and despite being made of
      <i>cuendillar</i>, they would break by a fall from a table.
