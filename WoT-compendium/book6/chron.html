  <Li><A Class="name">Lord of Chaos</A>, p. 10 (ix)&mdash;Entity that
      controls all things in chaos.  It could refer to
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>,
      or chaos in general.  The phrase is &ldquo;let the Lord of Chaos
      rule,&rdquo; and comes from a chant in the Fourth Age.

<H3>Prologue:  The First Message</H3>
<Img Src="../chapters/snakewheel.gif" Alt="chapter icon" Width="96" Height="97">
  <Li><A Class="name">Lord of Chaos</A>, p. 9&mdash;Personification of chaos
      itself.  The name is part of a poem, possibly a children's rhyme, and
      also the subject of the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>'s command to the
      Forsaken:  &ldquo;Let the Lord of Chaos Rule.&rdquo;
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Demandred">Demandred</A>, p. 13 (1)&mdash;One of
      the Forsaken.  He has a hawk-like nose and dark hair.  Second-best seems
      to be the story of his life.  He was born <A Href="#Barid">Barid Bel
      Medar</A> one day after <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A>, and
      from the first day proceeded to almost equal Lews Therin's
      accomplishments, almost equal Lews Therin's strength, and almost equal
      him but never surpass him in everything.  He became one of the Light's
      greatest generals, once again second in command under Lews Therin.
      Demandred believed that he was Lews Therin's intellectual and military
      superior, and was furious when Lews Therin was chosen to lead the
      Light's forces over him during the War of the Shadow.  He developed a
      burning hatred of Lews Therin, and finally dedicated his life to the
      Shadow so he could finally better Lews Therin&mdash;he believed the
      Shadow would eventually win the war since Lews Therin was commanding the
      Light's armies, and that if he, Barid Bel Medar, had been chosen to
      command them, the Light would have prevailed.  When Demandred was freed
      from the Bore, he transferred his hatred of Lews Therin to the new
      recipient of his soul, <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>.  Demandred was
      recently told by the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A> to lead his plan to
      convert or destroy Rand, and promised him to be
      <A Href="#Naeblis">Nae'blis</A> if he succeeded.  Demandred's assumed
      identity and whereabouts are unknown.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Barid">Medar, Barid Bel</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name">Great Lord of the Dark</A>, p. 14 (2)&mdash;Name
      that Forsaken and Friends of the Dark use for
      <A Href="#Dark">Shai'tan</A>, the Dark One, claiming that to use his
      true name would be blasphemy.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Shaidar">Shaidar Haran</A>, p. 14
      (3)&mdash;Myrddraal of special abilities who escorts the Chosen (i.e.
      Forsaken) to the Pit of Doom to converse with the <A Href="#Dark">Dark
      One</A>.  He is head and shoulders taller than all other Myrddraal, who
      are the height of an average man and all the same height.  His name
      means &ldquo;Hand of the Dark&rdquo; in the Old Tongue; most Myrddraal
      names come from the Trolloc tongue.  He is given special consideration;
      the ceiling of the entrance to the Pit of Doom does not brush his head
      as it does everyone else's.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Rahvin">Rahvin</A>, p. 15 (5)&mdash;One
      of the Forsaken.  He was fond of using Compulsion, and was known for
      being a ladies' man&mdash;he always had a woman on his arm.  After being
      released from the Bore, he took up residence in Caemlyn as
      <A Href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</A>, and used Compulsion to have
      <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A> not only make him her advisor, but
      her lover as well.  He eventually planned to take over the country
      directly as the first ever King of Andor&mdash;he did his best to weaken
      support for Morgase, exiling her supporters and befriending those who
      opposed her, finally chasing her from the country as well.  Shortly
      after news of Morgase's death or at least abdication reached Cairhien,
      Rahvin was confronted and killed by <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> in
      <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I> with a weave of balefire strong enough to burn
      Rahvin's soul out of the pattern for days, possibly all the way back to
      his release from the Bore.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Gaebril">Gaebril</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Lanfear">Lanfear</A>, p. 15 (5)&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  Unlike the rest of the Forsaken, she chose her name for
      herself, which means &ldquo;Daughter of the Night&rdquo; in the Old
      Tongue.  She was born Mierin Eronaile, and
      was strong in the One Power.  She worked at the Collam Daan, the primary
      facility for research into the One Power.  Her final discovery there was
      what she thought was a new source for the One Power, one that could be
      harnessed by men and women alike&mdash;this source turned out to be the
      emissions through a thin spot in the Pattern from the
      <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>'s prison.  She and another Aes Sedai named
      Beidomon bored into that prison, creating what is now referred to as
      simply the Bore, allowing the Dark One to touch the world again and
      leading to the War of the Shadow.  Around this time, Mierin had a
      relationship with <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A>, who headed
      the forces of the Light against the Shadow and was the most powerful and
      influential man she had found.  Lews Therin broke off the relationship
      when he found that she only wanted him for his power and authority and
      the possibility of power for herself through him.  Mierin never let go
      of him, and when he later met and married <A Href="#Ilyena">Ilyena
      Moerelle</A> she tried to disrupt the wedding ceremony as well as split
      the two apart by any means.  Eventually she went to Shayol Ghul to
      dedicate her soul to the Shadow, most likely to get back at Lews Therin
      for leaving her.  She declared as her territory the World of Dreams,
      <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>, using it to ends now unknown.  She transferred
      her obsessive love intact to Lews Therin's soul's new body,
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, after being freed from the Bore.  She
      first appeared to him as a young woman named Selene, disguising her
      appearance as a slightly less beautiful (but still stunning) woman.
      Almost a year later, Lanfear found that Rand had been
      &ldquo;unfaithful&rdquo; to her, and she tried to kill him.  Before she
      could, she was pushed through the twisted stone doorway
      <I>ter'angreal</I> leading to the lands of the Eelfinn by
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>, and became trapped.  It is not known
      whether Lanfear is still alive.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Asmodean">Asmodean</A>, p. 15 (5)&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  He was born Joar Addam Nessosin in the then
      coastal city of Shorelle, a child prodigy in music and art.  He gave his
      life to the Shadow in exchange for the immortality he received, so he
      could study and perfect his music.  After being released from the Bore,
      he was coerced by <A Href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</A> into coming with her,
      eventually to teach <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> to channel without killing
      himself.  Asmodean was drawn to Rhuidean and the stash of
      <I>angreal</I>, <I>ter'angreal</I>, and most especially the two white
      statue <I>ter'angreal</I> that linked the holder to the great
      <I>sa'angreal</I> buried near Cairhien and on Tremalking, which together
      could Break the World beyond repair.  He went there to obtain the male
      statue, but was thwarted by Rand, who severed his bonds to the
      <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>.  He then became Rand's teacher, and went
      into hiding from the rest of the Chosen, who would kill him on sight if
      they saw him.  He was killed by someone of yet unknown identity right
      after <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A> and Lanfear were killed/trapped.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Graendal">Graendal</A>, p. 15
      (5)&mdash;One of the Forsaken.  A fleshy woman with curled red-gold hair.
      Before the War of the Shadow, she became the leading authority on
      diseases of the brain, and spent much of her life dealing with the
      insane, schizophrenic, and others well beyond the touch of Healing.  She
      was the best at subtle manipulations of the human mind that ever lived.
      After the Bore was drilled, she went through a change after she realized
      the world could never live up to her standards.  So she began dressing
      in the very way she once mocked, with low cut dresses that clung to her
      and left little to the imagination.  After being released from the Bore,
      Graendal took up residence in Arad Doman, capturing several members of
      the Royal Family to use as servants.  All of her servants are not only
      physically well shaped and good-looking, but also had power in their
      society before she captured them.  She includes in her collection the
      sister of the Domani king, two rulers from Shara, and other important
      figures.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Basene">The Lady Basene</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Moghedien">Moghedien</A>, p. 15 (5)&mdash;One of
      the Forsaken.  Her name means &ldquo;Spider&rdquo; in the Old Tongue.
      She always works and attacks from safety and will run unless she can do
      so.  She developed a command of <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I> that surpassed
      even <A Href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</A>'s mastery&mdash;in the real world,
      Lanfear was more powerful, but even she could not top Moghedien in the
      World of Dreams.  After being released from the Bore, Moghedien
      eventually found herself in Tanchico, in the Palace of the
      Panarch of Tarabon.  While there, she chanced upon
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</A>, who was trying to save the
      Panarch at the time and take the seal on the <A Href="#Dark">Dark
      One</A>'s prison from its hold in the Palace.  She and Nynaeve fought in
      a duel to the last, and Nynaeve managed to better Moghedien, much to the
      surprise of both of them.  She managed to escape Nynaeve's tied off
      shield, and on their next encounter, this one in <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>,
      she ripped <A Href="#Birgitte">Birgitte</A>'s soul out of the World of
      Dreams after Birgitte almost killed her.  On her third encounter with
      Nynaeve, Nynaeve managed to trap Moghedien with an <I>a'dam</I>.
      Moghedien is currently bound by that <I>a'dam</I> in Salidar, disguised
      as <A Href="#Marigan">Marigan</A>.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Marigan">Marigan</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Dragon">Dragon</A>, p. 16
      (5)&mdash;Name by which <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A> was known
      during the War of the Shadow.  His rebirth, the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon
      Reborn</A>, is now alive and fulfilling all of the prophecies set to
      accompany him.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Rand">al'Thor, Rand</A>,
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>, <A Href="#Lews">Telamon, Lews
      Therin</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Naeblis">Nae'blis</A>, p. 16 (5)&mdash;The one who
      would stand only a step below the <A Href="#Dark">Dark
      One</A> on the Day of Return, commanding all Darkfriends in the Dark
      One's name.  The position has been promised to
      <A Href="#Demandred">Demandred</A> if he does well in his duties, but
      it is likely that <I>all</I> the Chosen were offered the position if
      they did well.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</A>, p.
      16 (6)&mdash;Young woman from Emond's Field.  She was the Wisdom of her
      village, the youngest ever chosen in Emond's Field.  She left when
      four of her villagers were taken away from the Two Rivers by
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> and <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>.  While the
      group traveled away from her home and toward her new life, Nynaeve made
      several discoveries:  she could channel the One Power, and had already
      done so without really knowing what she was doing; she developed
      feelings for al'Lan Mandragoran, Moiraine's Warder and the uncrowned
      king of the now dead nation Malkier; and she has a major role to play,
      as all of her younger friends in the group do, in the years to come.
      She is very strong in the One Power; only a select few who were alive
      during the Age of Legends could match her.  When she arrived in Tar
      Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a Novice, despite
      not being able to even <I>sense</I> the True Source unless angry, a
      result of her having to learn some minimal control of her ability
      without teaching.  She was sent on a false mission by
      <A Href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</A> on which she was almost leashed by the
      Seanchan as <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> was.  After she returned to the
      Tower, <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> sent her on a mission to hunt
      down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in
      Tanchico, she encountered <A Href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</A> and managed
      to better her in a duel of the Power.  Moghedien escaped, but two
      encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her,
      leashing her with an <I>a'dam</I> in <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>.  Nynaeve
      took Moghedien with her to seek out <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> and
      <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A> while they were fighting each other, and at
      the last moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin
      to ash with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could
      draw to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain
      control of himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire.  Nynaeve now keeps
      Moghedien under control with a modified <I>a'dam</I> in Salidar.
      Nynaeve wishes to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she
      thinks the Tower meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and
      wants no part of it.  She is determined to Heal anything short of death,
      from severing to the wound on Rand's side.  Nynaeve felt bad when
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> died, because her first thought was not
      of her, but that now Lan was free from their bond.  She was not told
      that Lan's bond had been passed to another at the moment of her death,
      or who that person is.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Lan">Mandragoran,
      Lan</A>; <A Href="#Marigan">Marigan</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Leane">Leane Sharif</A>, p. 16
      (6)&mdash;A woman from Arad Doman with coppery skin.  Just as her family
      members were training her in the seductive ways of Domani women, Leane
      found that her life would take a different direction; she could channel
      <I>saidar</I>, and would do so with or without teaching.  She became an
      Aes Sedai, a member of the Blue Ajah, and was eventually raised to
      <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A> under
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>.  During the coup led by
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida a'Roihan</A> and <A Href="#Alviarin">Alviarin
      Freidhen</A> that deposed Siuan, Leane was thrown in the dungeon and
      stilled.  Leane has turned to her seductive side to try to replace what
      she lost in stilling; she is out of practice, but does well enough.  She
      eventually convinced the Aes Sedai in Salidar to let her stay with them
      and maintain the network of eyes-and-ears she kept in Tar Valon as
      Keeper.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Anjen">Anjen</A>;
      <A Href="#Alviarin">Freidhen, Alviarin</A>; <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of
      the Chronicles</A>; <A Href="#Siuan">Sanche, Siuan</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>, p. 16 (6)&mdash;Born in
      Tear to a fisherman, she was sent to the White Tower on the
      first boat to leave after she discovered she had the ability to channel
      inborn, according to Tairen law.  As a novice, she was good friends with
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine Damodred</A>, and was present at
      <A Href="#Gitara">Gitara Moroso</A>'s Foretelling of the Rebirth of the
      <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>.  After being raised to the shawl, she
      joined the Blue Ajah to dedicate her life to finding and guiding the
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>, and eventually came
      to lead the Blues' network of eyes-and-ears (i.e. spies) before being
      raised to the <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>.  She was only thirty
      years old when raised to the Amyrlin Seat, making her the youngest
      Amyrlin to date.  When her lifelong connection to the
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> was discovered, she and her
      <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A>, <A Href="#Leane">Leane
      Sharif</A>, were deposed and stilled by a group of sisters loyal to
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida a'Roihan</A>.  Siuan hopes to regain some of
      her previous standing in the new Tower that has separated from
      Elaida&mdash;her knowledge of the Blue Ajah spy network is hard to
      match, and she knows much that she thinks would be of use.  In one of
      her viewings, <A Href="#Min">Min</A> saw that Siuan would have to remain
      close by to <A Href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</A>&mdash;if she did not, both
      of them would die.  Siuan did not initially know what she meant, but now
      realizes that she is growing to love the gray-haired man who leads the
      Salidar army.  She had a Warder named <A Href="#Alric">Alric</A>, but he
      died when she was deposed.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Alric">Alric</A>;

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Lan">al'Lan Mandragoran</A>, p. 17 (7)&mdash;The
      uncrowned king of Malkier, and formerly Warder to
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>.  He is quite tall, and does not get
      very emotional&mdash;in fact, he has emotional walls all around him that
      he has been building for years.  His country, Malkier, was overrun by
      Trollocs shortly after he was born, and is now corrupted by the Great
      Blight.  Lan, the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a one-man
      war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight.  He fought
      Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status.  He was
      eventually bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at least
      changed its style).  When Lan and Moiraine brought
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>, <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>,
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A>, <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>, and
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> out of their home in the Two Rivers, he
      found that there was something which could throw his guard down, but he
      was the last to notice it:  affection for Nynaeve.  As Moiraine put it,
      Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan's emotional walls and break them
      down without him even knowing they were there.  He loves her very much,
      whether he admits it openly or not, and Nynaeve, to her surprise, loves
      him in return.  Upon Moiraine's death, Lan's bond was immediately
      transferred to another Aes Sedai, and he was last seen leaving the
      wagons near Cairhien to seek her out.  <I>See also

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Elayne">Elayne Trakand</A>, p. 17
      (7)&mdash;The <A Href="#DH">Daughter-Heir of Andor</A>, now one of the
      Accepted.  She is the daughter of <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A>
      and her late husband, <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail</A>, and sister to
      <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>.  She is also half-sister to
      <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A>, although she would rather not be reminded of
      this fact; she thinks Galad virtuous to the point of fault, and does not
      really like him.  She has considerable potential in the One Power, and
      will most likely be the strongest Aes Sedai in a thousand years or more,
      possibly since the Age of Legends, with the exception of
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> and <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>.  She has
      red-gold curly hair.  During her stay in the Stone of Tear, Elayne
      realized she loved <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, and told him how she
      felt; he felt similarly.  She had no idea at the time what
      <A Href="#Min">Min</A> meant about &ldquo;having to share him,&rdquo; but
      now knows about Min's viewing of Rand with the three women's heads,
      indicating that Rand will fall in love with Min, Elayne, and
      <A Href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</A>, and they with him.  Later, when she and
      Nynaeve had trouble with <A Href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</A>, Elayne ended
      up bonding <A Href="#Birgitte">Birgitte</A> as her Warder (despite being
      only Accepted) in order to save Birgitte's life.  Elayne is currently
      with the Aes Sedai in Salidar.  <I>See also</I>

      (8)&mdash;Formerly Aes Sedai of the Red Ajah, now raised to the
      <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A> in Tar Valon.  She served as advisor
      to <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A> of Andor for her entire reign,
      and led the coup that deposed <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> and
      placed her on the Amyrlin Seat in her place.  She distrusts anyone
      not of the Red Ajah (as most Reds do), and thinks she will never trust
      any member of the Blue Ajah again, even in the slightest.  Her
      <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A> is
      <A Href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</A> of the White Ajah&mdash;she
      was all but forced to choose Alviarin due to her role in the deposition
      of Siuan.  If she chose a Keeper from her Ajah, she most likely would
      not have won the support of the White Ajah, and then <I>she</I> would
      have been stilled and banished from the Tower instead of Siuan.  She
      sometimes has the Foretelling, but not all that often or that strongly.
      One of her Foretellings was that the Royal Family of Andor would play a
      crucial role in the Last Battle&mdash;this Foretelling occurred around
      the time the Succession was going on, so she immediately attached
      herself to Morgase as soon as it became clear that she would be the one
      to take the Lion Throne.  Another was to predict that
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> would shake the world on its very
      foundations&mdash;she constantly kicks herself for not doing something
      about him when he was in front of her, little more than a farmboy at the
      time.  The Foretelling about Rand is obviously deadly accurate, but the
      one about the Royal Family occurred at an inopportune time; at the time
      of Elaida's Foretelling, the Royal Family wasn't certain.  It may have
      meant Morgase, <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>, <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A>,
      and <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> (they have all had a large role to play
      in the recent past), but it is also possible it could have meant the old
      Royal Family, that of <A Href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</A>,
      <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail</A>, Galad, and later Elayne and Gawyn as
      well.  After all, Morgase is just Morgase, but Tigraine is the mother of
      the Dragon Reborn.  Elaida is quite strong in the One Power; only Siuan,

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>, p. 17 (7)&mdash;Leader
      of the Aes Sedai, their equivalent of a King or Queen.  She in theory
      holds supreme power amongst the sisters, and leads the Hall of the Tower
      at its meetings.  Kings and queens of nations strong and weak will come
      if summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their entire trip
      figuring out how they will put a knife in her back while there.  The
      Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in
      her character.  The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must
      the vote to depose one.  Once chosen the Amyrlin is said to be &ldquo;of
      all Ajahs and none&rdquo;--all previous affiliations with Ajah are
      ignored (at least in theory).  The Ajahs get fairly equal numbers of
      Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions:  no Amyrlin has
      been raised from the Red Ajah since <A Href="#Bonwhin">Bonwhin</A>, who
      was deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in
      <A Href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</A>'s day, except for
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</A>, the current Amyrlin
      Seat in Tar Valon; the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of
      Amyrlins from its Ajah&mdash;four of the last the last five Amyrlins
      (before Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah.  These two exceptions to
      the mean number of Amyrlins from one's Ajah have only added to the
      friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years.  The Amyrlin has
      a secretary of sorts, the <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the
      Chronicles</A>, who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the
      Amyrlin was raised from.  The office was held by <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan
      Sanche</A>, raised from the Blue Ajah, until she was deposed for her
      involvement with events surrounding the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon
      Reborn</A>.  Her successor was the leader of the coup, Elaida, raised
      from the Red Ajah.  Siuan's deposition divided the Tower, and the

      proclaimed to be the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  He is very
      tall, with curly red-blond hair.  He was raised by <A Href="#Tam">Tam
      al'Thor</A> and his wife <A Href="#Kari">Kari</A> (until her death
      around the time Rand was five) in Emond's Field.  His real parents,
      however, were <A Href="#Janduin">Janduin</A>, the chief of the Taardad
      Aiel who brought the four clans across the Dragonwall to punish
      <A Href="#Laman">Laman</A>'s Sin, and a Maiden of the Spear named
      <A Href="#Shaiel">Shaiel</A>, who was actually
      <A Href="#Tigraine">Tigraine Damodred</A>, the runaway
      <A Href="#DH">Daughter-Heir of Andor</A>.  Tigraine gave birth to Rand
      on the slopes of Dragonmount, in accordance with prophecy; &ldquo;born of
      a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the Old.&rdquo;  Rand has a
      heron branded into each of his palms, which he received from the sword
      Tam gave him while fighting <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A>.  He also
      has two dragons on his forearms, which he recieved in Rhuidean to
      designate him as the <A Href="#Caracarn">Car'a'carn</A>, the Chief of
      Chiefs of the Aiel.  He is not only the Dragon Reborn, but also
      <A Href="#Dawn">He Who Comes With the Dawn</A>, the man prophecied to
      reunite the Aiel, and the <A Href="#Coramoor">Coramoor</A>, the one

      obviously of equal strength), and is also <I>ta'veren</I>, the most
      strongly so since Lews Therin as well.  Lews Therin's voice has somehow
      found a new place inside of Rand's head; he talks to him in a mad voice
      when Rand least expects it, sometimes offering sound advice or
      knowledge, sometimes babbling, sometimes even trying to wrest control of
      <I>saidin</I> from him.  Unlike Lews Therin, Rand is accompanied by two
      other <I>ta'veren</I> during this turing of the Wheel, two men born
      within days (hours, even) of him named <A Href="#Mat">Matrim Cauthon</A>
      and <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A>, who both grew up in Emond's

      the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  He is working on having the

      She married <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</A>, a prince of
      Cairhien, to further solidify her claim to the Throne of Andor; when
      <A Href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</A> disappeared, Morgase made the best
      claim to succeed her, and married her widower to gain the support that
      would be gained by such action.  Taringail died when Elayne and Gawyn
      father; he died when they were young.  Morgase has since gone through
      several lovers, including <A Href="#Thom">Thomdril Merrilin</A>, a
      former court-bard; <A Href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</A>, her First Prince

      stilled the riots in Caemlyn that sprang up on Morgase's trip to Tar

      city of Caemlyn when he started telling her what he really thought of
      some of her plans, her relationship with Bryne ebbed away until finally
      Gaebril told her to exile him too, and Gaebril eventually chased Morgase
      herself out of the city when she found he was usurping her power.  The
      Daughter-Heir of Andor is traditionally trained by Aes Sedai in the
      White Tower, and Morgase underwent novice training to keep the tradition
      alive.  She was given the gift of a Great Serpent ring despite not being

      when she learned that the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> had taken
      over Caemlyn and none of her former supporters would give her aid, she
      fled to Amadicia to get help from the only place she thought she could:

      not aware that <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> only wants to give her country
      back to her, not to mention believes that she is dead.  If she made her
      presence known, she would no doubt have her country back in one piece
      and all would be well, but as royalty she believes she must work on her
      own and trust no one.  The entire world believes Morgase dead except for
      a select few, all of which are in Amadicia at the moment.

      half-sister, and <A Href="#Laman">King Laman</A>'s niece.  She is
      considered short among her people, and the Cairhienin are already a
      short people.  When it was discovered that she had the ability to
      channel inborn, Moiraine went to Tar Valon to become an Aes Sedai.  Just
      before being raised to the shawl, she and her friend
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> witnessed
      <A Href="#Gitara">Gitara Moroso</A>'s Foretelling of the Rebirth of the
      <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>.  Moiraine and Siuan walked away from each
      other and did not speak to each other again (at least in public), but
      both held secret communication with each other and dedicated their lives
      to finding and guiding the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.
      Moiraine found the young man she sought on Winternight in Emond's
      Field, a young man named <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, along with
      two more <I>ta'veren</I>, <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A> and

      raised to the shawl, she met <A Href="#Lan">al'Lan Mandragoran</A>, the
      uncrowned King of Malkier, who was fighting alone against the Shadow in
      the Blight; she asked Lan to become her Warder, and he accepted.  She is
      very strong in the Power, stronger than almost all living Aes Sedai.  In
      the Stone of Tear, Moiraine confronted and killed the Forsaken
      <A Href="#Belal">Be'lal</A> with balefire, just before he would have
      killed Rand.  Later, after having an inkling of the future events from
      the testing <I>ter'angreal</I> for the Wise Ones, Moiraine managed to
      push the Forsaken <A Href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</A> through the twisted
      doorway <I>ter'angreal</I> into the land of the Eelfinn, trapping both
      her and Lanfear there.  It is unknown whether Moiraine lives on in the
      land off the Finn, or whether she is dead, but her bond with Lan has
      been severed, and other Aes Sedai consider her a legend, not only for
      discovering the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> but for killing or

      attack on Winternight.  On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger
      from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which
      he carried with him for a long time.  He was separated from the dagger
      by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory
      sequence.  These gaps were filled and more when he passed through the
      twisted door to the land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three
      requests:  a foxhead medallion that protected him from women's
      channeling, a way out of the land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of
      past lifetimes that were the gaps in his memory.  Mat's <I>ta'veren</I>
      qualities manifest themselves particularly well with random events, such
      as dice games&mdash;he almost never loses a toss of the dice, even if
      the dice are weighted.  He has found that battles are the ultimate form
      of gambling, and along with his newfound memories he can win almost
      every battle he fights quite decisively.  He has four sisters, including
      <A Href="#Eldrin">Eldrin</A> and <A Href="#Bode">Bodewhin</A>, who are
      17 and 16, respectively.  His father <A Href="#Abell">Abell</A> is one
      of the best archers in the Two Rivers, possibly in the World.  Mat has
      gotten in the habit of carrying concealed knives under his clothes in
      case he is attacked&mdash;his collection would surprise anyone.  In the
      Waste, he met a woman named <A Href="#Melindhra">Melindhra</A>, a Maiden
      of the Spear from the Shaido Clan.  However, she is not the
      <A Href="#9Moons">Daughter of the Nine Moons</A>, who Mat is destined to
      marry according to the Aelfinn; besides, she tried to kill him on orders
      from her master among the Darkfriends.  Mat had to kill her to save his
      own skin, but regrets it deeply.  He has a scar along his neck from
      where the Eelfinn tried to kill him&mdash;which was also in accordance
      with what the Aelfinn told him, that he is &ldquo;to die and live
      again.&rdquo; He currently heads an army called the Band of the Red
      Hand, after the army of <A Href="#Aemon">King Aemon</A> of old
      Manetheren, and serves in a way as Rand's personal general&mdash;this
      works well, since Mat seems to be a better general than even
      <A Href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</A>, who has earned his good
      reputation as one of the best commanders alive.  Mat does not trust any
      Aes Sedai, and because of this refuses to take his foxhead medallion off
      even to bathe.  <I>See also</I>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Perrin">Perrin t'Bashere
      Aybara</A>, p. 21 (13)&mdash;A young man from Emond's Field.  He is
      <I>ta'veren</I>.  When he and <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> got separated
      from the rest of the group while fleeing the Trollocs on Winternight,
      Perrin met a man named <A Href="#Elyas">Elyas Machera</A>.  Elyas, a
      former Warder who found he could talk to wolves, helped Perrin discover
      the same ability in himself.  Perrin's eyes are now yellow, just like
      the wolves' eyes, and he can enter what he calls the Wolf Dream (known
      to most as <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>, the World of Dreams) with them.
      Perrin is a childhood friend of fellow <I>ta'veren</I>
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> and <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A>.  On
      the way to Tear, Perrin encountered a young woman by the name of
      <A Href="#Zarine">Zarine Bashere</A>, a Hunter for the Horn who took the
      name of <A Href="#Faile">Faile</A> (which means &ldquo;Falcon&rdquo; in
      the Old Tongue) as a more appropriate name for a Hunter for the Horn.
      The two are now married.  Perrin is a very large man&mdash;he was
      always a big person, which caused him to be very cautious since he found
      as a child that he could easily hurt other children if his temper got
      out of hand.  His size helps considerably when helping
      <A Href="#Haral">Master Luhhan</A> on his forge, but sometimes gives
      others the impression that he is slow and stupid.  He is currently in
      the Two Rivers, helping to rebuild the area after the series of Trolloc
      attacks; he and his wife serve as Lord and Lady there, the first lord of
      the Two Rivers since the Trolloc Wars.  <I>See also</I>

      (15)&mdash;A young woman from Baerlon.  She has a special ability that
      few besides herself know about:  she sees images and auras around
      people, especially around Aes Sedai and Warders, that foretell their
      futures.  Min does not always know what these viewings mean, but when
      she does, it <I>will</I> happen; it is only a question of how and when.
      Min was fascinated by the number of images she saw around
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>, especially the one she saw that included
      herself:  he is destined to fall in love with three different women, one
      of which is herself.  She usually dresses in attire reserved for men;
      this habit was picked up when growing up with her father, who was a
      miner.  However, once she started to develop feelings for Rand, she
      began to wear more traditionally feminine attire.  Min was in Tar Valon
      helping <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A> with her viewings' information when
      Siuan was deposed, and it was Min that freed Siuan and
      <A Href="#Leane">Leane</A> from the dungeon.  She accompanied the two
      former leaders of the Aes Sedai to Salidar; once there, she left for

      during the chaos surrounding the deposing of <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan
      Sanche</A>, and eventually was escorted out of Tar Valon by Siuan and
      her traveling companions.  Before he was gentled he was of considerable
      strength, and attracted quite a following of loyal soldiers.
      <A Href="#Min">Min</A> still has viewings of him with a halo over his
      head, which she thinks indicates that he will become a figure of
      great power sometime in the future.  Recently, Logain has come forward
      with information that indicates the Red Ajah actually put him up to
      declaring himself the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>, most likely
      with the pretext that bringing down a false Dragon would be less likely
      to be negatively critiqued than gentling a simple man who could channel.

      First Prince of the Sword and Captain of the Queen's Guards under
      <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A> in Andor.  He was appointed to the
      position because Morgase had no living male relatives, but was exiled
      from Caemlyn on a suggestion from Morgase's new advisor,
      <A Href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</A>.  He moved to his private estates
      in rural Andor, where he presided over the trial of three young women
      who unintentionally burned a barn: they turned out to be
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>, the former <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin

      <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A>, and
      <A Href="#Min">Min Farshaw</A>.  When these three made an oath to serve
      him and then apparently broke it, he followed them out of sheer
      curiosity to Salidar.  Once their, he discovered the true identity of
      the three, as well as that the Tower was truly broken.  The Aes Sedai in
      Salidar persuaded him to command the army they would need to take the
      Amyrlin Seat from <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>, since he was the only
      commander that the Warders thought would be willing and able to help

      it, Bryne seems to be developing feelings for Siuan Sanche; he wishes to
      avoid another mistake like his relationship as

      and their oldest surviving offspring.  Her two older brothers were
      killed, and when Davram sent her younger brother off to fight while
      keeping her at home, she ran away and swore the oath of a Hunter of the
      Horn in Illian.  When she became a Hunter, she renounced her old name,
      <A Href="#Zarine">Zarine</A>, at first considering adopting the name
      &ldquo;Mandarb&rdquo;&mdash;she chose Faile when she found Mandarb was

      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A> while on her search for the Horn,
      who told her that the Horn had been found.  She was shocked, but even
      more so to find out that <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> was the
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> and that both he and Perrin are
      <I>ta'veren</I>.  Faile stayed near Perrin, and finally accompanied him
      to the Two Rivers where she helped fend off the Trolloc attacks; the two
      were married shortly afterwards.  They were then proclaimed Lord and
      Lady of the Two Rivers.  Perrin hated the idea, but Faile insisted they
      have a modest estate, and even servants, which she trained herself.  Her
      name means &ldquo;falcon&rdquo; in the Old Tongue; she is the falcon in
      <A Href="#Min">Min</A>'s viewings of Perrin.  She is very protective of
      her husband, and does whatever she can to make sure he not so much as

      raised Rand as their own son.  Tam always won the archery competitions
      (or came in second to <A Href="#Abell">Abell Cauthon</A>), and passed
      his archery skills on to Rand.  He also taught <A Href="#Aram">Aram</A>
      how to use his sword.  It is not known if Tam knew that the child
      he was raising was the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  <I>See

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aram">Aram</A>, p. 38 (38)&mdash;Former
      Tuatha'an who gave up the Way of the Leaf to learn the sword when the
      Trollocs killed his mother.  He learned from <A Href="#Tam">Tam
      al'Thor</A>, <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s father and a Blademaster, and
      picked it up extremely fast.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Loial">Loial</A>, p. 38 (39)&mdash;Son of
      <A Href="#Arent">Arent</A> son of <A Href="#Halan">Halan</A>, an Ogier
      from Stedding Shangtai.  He left the <I>stedding</I> at around age 90 to
      see the world; by Ogier standards, he is not yet old enough to leave the
      <I>stedding</I> without permission from the Council of Elders.  He is
      fond of books and history, and is an excellent Treesinger.  He is
      writing a book about his travels with the three <I>ta'veren</I> he
      meets, <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A>,
      and <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A>.  Loial is constantly afraid
      that his mother will find him and try to marry him off and settle him
      down.  He, like most of the Ogier, is sad that most humans do not
      remember the Ogier, and is horrified that some even think he is a
      Trolloc on first seeing him.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Abell">Abell Cauthon</A>, p. 39
      (40)&mdash;<A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>'s father.  He and his wife
      <A Href="#Natti">Natti</A> live in Emond's Field with their two
      unmarried daughters <A Href="#Eldrin">Eldrin</A> and
      <A Href="#Bode">Bodewhin</A>.  They have two other daughters.  Abell is
      excellent with a bow and arrow, and is in general a really nice guy; Mat
      does not know of anyone that dislikes him.  His children are about the
      age where they start to leave home&mdash;twenty, seventeen, and sixteen
      for Mat, Eldrin, and Bode respectively.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Gawyn">Gawyn Trakand</A>, p. 40 (41)&mdash;Son of
      <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A> of Andor and brother to
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>.  He will become First Prince of the Sword
      when Elayne becomes Queen.  He and his half-brother
      <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A> went to train with the Warders in the White
      Tower, as all sons of Andoran queens have for centuries, and both now
      possess considerable skill with the sword.  During the chaos that
      erupted after <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>'s deposition, Gawyn
      formed a band of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders
      except Galad, who are called the Younglings.  The Younglings fought back
      against their teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and
      <A Href="#Leane">Leane</A> from their imprisonment.  Gawyn himself
      killed <A Href="#Hammar">Hammar</A> and <A Href="#Coulin">Coulin</A>,
      the men in charge of teaching the sword and for his personal training,
      respectively, both of which are Blademasters&mdash;few Warders are as
      good as they were, and Gawyn managed to kill both of them.  Gawyn does
      not know which party to support&mdash;he believes that anyone who
      opposes Tower Law by trying to free Siuan and Leane is wrong, but at the
      same time he doesn't know all the facts surrounding the change in
      leadership.  In fact, his sister Elayne and her friends
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</A> and
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A> side with those who broke from the
      Tower.  This is especially difficult since Gawyn has feelings for
      Egwene, feelings which she returns.  He believes the rumor that
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> killed his mother, and only refrains from
      killing him because Egwene made him promise not to.  His sign is a white
      boar.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Jisao">Jisao Hamora</A>, p. 40 (42)&mdash;Youngest

      (44)&mdash;A Lord Captain of the Children of the Light.  He commanded the
      troops that were near Tar Valon, and gave <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A> the
      information on the Whitecloaks when he said he was curious.  Once Galad
      joined the Whitecloak army, Valda promoted him quickly because of his
      swordsmanship skill, claiming that he deserved recognition for his skill
      regardless of where he obtained it.  Valda thinks that
      <A Href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</A>'s time as Lord Captain Commander of the
      Children of the Light is coming to an end&mdash;his skill as a military
      commander earned him the right to have the position as long as he has,
      but Valda thinks he is getting too old to be effective.  Valda plans to
      succeed him himself, but letting others know of this would undoubtedly
      mean a dagger through Valda's ribs, so he keeps it to himself.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Niall">Pedron Niall</A>, p. 42 (44)&mdash;Lord
      Captain Commander of the Children of the Light, highest office

      several Aiel chiefs.  He is trying to get Altara and Murandy to cede land
      to Illian so the Council of Nine won't invade both countries.  He is also
      trying to expand Amadicia's borders into parts of Ghealdan.  His
      headquarters is in Amadicia, and he rules there even above
      <A Href="#Ailron">King Ailron</A>, although this is not spoken of openly.
      Niall recently offered a treaty with <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A>
      of Andor, offering Whitecloak assistance to retake her throne in exchange
      for Whitecloak presence in Caemlyn and elsewhere in Andor, a presence

      almost everyone, she is actually a member of the Black Ajah.  She was
      the one who beat <A Href="#Tarna">Tarna Feir</A>'s block out of her;
      Galina knew she would choose Red before Tarna did.

      (50)&mdash;Self-appointed chief of the Shaido Aiel after the death of
      its last true chief, <A Href="#Suladric">Suladric</A>.  He never went to
      Rhuidean, but declared himself the

      <A Href="#Asmodean">Asmodean</A> placed two dragons on his arms in a
      copy of those on <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s arms.  When the rest of the
      Aiel chiefs declared for Rand, Couladin took the Shaido west across the
      Spine of the World to ravage Cairhien.  Although almost every other clan
      despises the Shaido, all agree that even they deserved a real
      chief&mdash;they never got one.  Couladin died outside Cairhien while
      fighting <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A>&mdash;Mat killed him, but later
      remarked that Couladin had to have been born with a spear in his hands
      to be that good.  After his death, the remnants of his clan fled to
      Kinslayer's Dagger under the command of his widow,
      <A Href="#Sevanna">Sevanna</A>.  His head was placed on a pike while
      Mat's troops danced around it and the rest of the Aiel spit on it.

      too long, and his ears are to big.  He has little real power as king; the
      true power in Amadicia is <A Href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</A> and the
      Children of the Light.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Tallanvor">Martyn Tallanvor</A>, p.
      47 (52)&mdash;Tall young man from Andor.  He served in the Queen's Guards
      until <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A> fled Andor.  When
      <A Href="#Gaebril">Gaebril</A> had the guards swear new oaths to the
      laws and customs of Andor (instead of to the Queen), Tallanvor swore them
      but immediately went back to his room and reswore the old oath in the old
      style (cutting his arm with his sword, indicating that his blood will be
      shed before the Queen's will).  He loves his queen more than his life,
      and now serves as her personal bodyguard.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Gaebril">Gaebril</A>, p. 48 (53)&mdash;Man
      who came to Caemlyn just as riots sprang up throughout the city.  He
      joined and led the faction that restored order in the city, and upon
      <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A>'s return, he gave her her kingdom in
      one piece, as it was when she left.  Allegedly, she was so happy that he
      had done this that she made Gaebril her new advisor.  However, during
      <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>'s trip through Caemlyn to deliver
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>'s letter, Mat overheard Gaebril ordering
      someone to kill Elayne and anyone else with her&mdash;he tried to find a
      way to report this information to Morgase, but ended up telling Elayne.
      Gaebril was discovered to be <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A>, one
      of the Forsaken, who has a preference to having pretty women around him.
      His &ldquo;pretty woman&rdquo; is Morgase, and he planned to wrest
      control of Andor from her.  Morgase realized he was controlling her and
      left the country so quickly a rumor sprang up that she had been killed;
      when Caemlyn was taken by <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> and Rahvin killed,
      the rumor changed to say that Rand had killed Morgase, instead of
      Gaebril.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A>.

      Trakand.  She has many wise sayings, which Elayne and Morgase are fond
      of quoting to themselves and others (probably because they have been
      ingrained into their minds so much).  She went with Morgase when she fled
      Andor to Amadicia.

      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> back from Falme to Tar Valon.  Her Warder
      is named <A Href="#Tomas">Tomas</A>.  She is more interested in current
      events than the average Brown; most of them couldn't care less what
      happened now, only what happened years ago.  She gave Egwene the twisted
      stone ring <I>ter'angreal</I> to assist her in Dreaming, and also once
      told <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A> that there was really no need to keep
      her in the Tower until she learned to control her ability when she was a
      novice, since she wouldn't ever be able to do much with it anyway.  When
      Verin went to the Two Rivers with <A Href="#Alanna">Alanna</A>, they
      helped to fight the Trollocs that attacked, and when they left they
      brought a half-dozen young women with them who could channel, including
      <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>'s sister <A Href="#Bode">Bode</A>.  When she and
      Alanna reached Caemlyn, they found that the Tower had been broken, and
      decided to side with the Salidar embassy when it reached town.  Verin is
      quite old&mdash;her hair is starting to turn gray, which to an Aes Sedai
      means she is quite old indeed.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Dyelin">Dyelin Taravin</A>, p. 50
      (57)&mdash;Next-in-line to the Lion Throne after
      <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A> and <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>.  She
      refuses to take the throne without absolute confirmation of the deaths of
      both of them, despite the feelings of some of Morgase's former
      supporters.  She is Morgase's cousin.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Galad">Galadedrid (Galad) Damodred</A>, p. 51

      <A Href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</A>.  He is half-brother to
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> and <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>.  Stunningly
      handsome, even <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> has trouble blushing when
      she speaks to him, and Aes Sedai will often forsook their work to watch
      him practice (shirtless) in the sword yard.  Galad has much skill with
      the sword, and has acheived Blademaster status in practice if not in
      name.  He disappeared from Tar Valon during the violence that
      accompanied <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A>'s deposition and joined
      <A Href="#Valda">Eamon Valda</A>'s band of the Children of the Light.
      Because of his sword skill, Galad was promoted to an official position
      very quickly, and now controls his own small band of men.  He says he
      became a Whitecloak because it &ldquo;felt right.&rdquo;  He is
      extremely virtuous, and will do whatever he thinks is right regardless
      of who it hurts, even himself.  His sign is a winged silver sword, point
      down.  Galad has feelings for <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A>, and
      although she is flattered by his attentions, she doesn't return his
      love.

      instead of just making it happen.  The Forsaken and most Darkfriends
      consider Him to be inferior to the Dark One, despite the fact that He
      imprisoned him.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Balwer">Sebban Balwer</A>, p. 54
      (62)&mdash;Personal secretary to <A Href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</A>.
      He has knobby shoulders and skinny legs.  He believes nothing he is
      told.  The post is actually a ruse; the pinch-faced man is actually the
      Master of Spies for the Children of the Light, and the Spymaster
      presented to the world is just a decoy.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Carridin">Jaichim Carridin</A>, p.
      54 (62)&mdash;An Inquisitor for the Hand of the Light, better known as the
      Questioners; he aspires to some day become High Inquisitor, perhaps even
      Lord Captain Commander.  Surprisingly enough for a Whitecloak, much less
      a Questioner, Carridin is a Darkfriend.  He was given orders (under the
      name <A Href="#Bors">Bors</A>) by <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A> to
      find and kill <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, and those orders were
      strengthened by a Myrddraal who promised to kill another member of
      Carridin's family every month until al'Thor was dead.  So far, Carridin
      has lost a cousin (found skinned alive in his bed) and his youngest sister
      <A Href="#Dealda">Dealda</A> (carried from her bridal feast by a Fade).
      He expects his sister, <A Href="#Vanora">Vanora</A>, to be next.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Guaire">Guaire Amalasan</A>, p. 55
      (64)&mdash;False Dragon of centuries past, from Free Years 939-943.  He
      started the War of the Second Dragon and conquered much of the world
      between the Aiel Waste and the Aryth Ocean before a young king named
      <A Href="#Artur">Artur Paendrag Tanreall</A> rose to overwhelming
      prominence and power.  Six Aes Sedai once attempted to capture him by
      themselves&mdash;he killed one of them and stilled two more.  It took a
      full circle of thirteen to finally capture him, and during his trial his
      followers beseiged Tar Valon and tried to free him, getting as far as
      the White Tower itself before being turned back.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Artur">Artur Paendrag Tanreall</A>,
      p. 55 (64)&mdash;Real name of Artur Hawkwing.  <I>See</I>
      <A Href="#Hawkwing">Hawkwing, Artur</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</A>, p. 55
      (64)&mdash;Hero of Legend who conquered much of the known world about a
      thousand years ago.  He was perhaps the most strongly <I>ta'veren</I>
      man besides <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A> and
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>.  His armies put down those of
      <A Href="#Guaire">Guaire Amalasan</A>, a false Dragon, and he even sent
      troops across the Aryth Ocean under his son, <A Href="#Luthair">Luthair
      Paendrag Mondwhin</A>, in hopes of conquering new lands there.  All
      contact with these armies ended with Hawkwing's death, which set off the
      War of the Hundred Years.  The descendants of the armies under Luthair
      have now returned to reclaim the lands of Hawkwing's empire in the Old
      World&mdash;they now call themselves the Seanchan.  Artur Hawkwing's
      real name was <A Href="#Artur">Artur Paendrag Tanreall</A>; his sign was
      a golden hawk in flight.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Mesaana">Mesaana</A>, p. 55 (65)&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  During the Age of Legends, Mesaana was told she was unfit to
      do research at the Collam Daan, but was capable of teaching others.  She
      spent her years teaching until the Bore was opened and she dedicated her
      life to the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>.  During the War of Power, she
      created &ldquo;schools&rdquo; for the children, at which she taught the
      children to spy on their parents and other such things.  After her
      release from the Bore, Mesaana set herself up in the White Tower, where
      she could control events without anyone suspecting she was behind them.
      She has been cooperating with <A Href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</A> to some
      extent.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Semirhage">Semirhage</A>, p. 56 (65)&mdash;One of
      the Forsaken.  During the Age of Legends, she was one of the best
      Healers ever known.  She was called to all corners of the world Heal
      people that others thought beyond help.  However, she was sadistic; she
      exacted a price in the form of pain from her subjects in return for her
      Healing services.  Most thought the pain or anguish she exacted from
      them was a small price to pay for being alive, but eventually the Hall
      of Servants found out about her practices and gave her the choice of
      being severed or bound with the Power, never again to know her
      &ldquo;pleasures.&rdquo;   She chose instead to pledge for the
      <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>, and created one of the most oppressive and
      pain-filled areas of Shadow control during the entire War of Power.
      After being freed from the Bore, Semirhage went in service to the Dark
      One by extracting information from captured Borderlanders and Aes Sedai.
      She also sent the Trollocs to the Stone of Tear to battle those that
      <A Href="#Sammael">Sammael</A> sent.  She is as tall as most men, and
      wears black most of the time&mdash;perhaps because
      <A Href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</A> always wore white.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A>, p. 57
      (66)&mdash;The <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>, Breaker of the World.  He
      was perhaps the greatest man who ever lived, and the most powerful Aes
      Sedai in recorded history.  During the War of the Shadow, he led the
      forces of the Light against the Forsaken, and led the final stroke which
      re-sealed the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A> back into his prison.
      Unfortunately, during this stroke he was driven insane by the Dark One's
      touch, eventually killing his wife <A Href="#Ilyena">Ilyena</A>, his
      children, and everyone he loved, as well as anyone who carried a drop of
      his blood.  For this act, people remember him with a new name:
      <A Href="#Kinslayer">Kinslayer</A>.  After he had done this,
      <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A> gave him his sanity back long enough
      for him to realize what he had done; Lews Therin killed himself by
      drawing on <I>saidin</I> too heavily, causing a mountain to form on the
      spot where he stood.  This mountain is called Dragonmount, and is near
      the present-day city of Tar Valon.  It is unfortunate that the name of
      one of the greatest men to ever live is now synonymous with evil, for
      Lews Therin killed his family due to the Dark One's influence, but
      without Lews Therin there may not have been a world left in which to
      kill them.  Lews Therin's voice sometimes speaks inside
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s head, offering advice or sobbing over lost
      women, but is getting more and more vocal.  It even tries to seize
      control of <I>saidin</I> sometimes, much to Rand's fear.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Sammael">Sammael</A>, p. 57 (67)&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  During the War of the Shadow, he was one of the Shadow's
      greatest military commanders.  His name means &ldquo;Destroyer of
      Hope&rdquo; in the Old Tongue.  After being released from the Bore, he
      took up residence on the Council of Nine in Illian as
      <A Href="#Brend">Lord Brend</A>, and effectively rules the country.  He
      bears a battle scar that he got while fighting
      <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A> during the War of the Shadow.
      He could have had it Healed, but kept it to remind himself of what Lews

      sons lived past age twenty, hence the tradition of only having a queen

<!-- Page 80: Seals on DO's prison are the size of a man's _palm_.  -->
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Cheade">Muad Cheade</A>, p. 81 (100)&mdash;Former
      Marshal-General of Saldaea.  <A Href="#Bashere">Bashere</A> says he was
      &ldquo;mad as a hare in spring thaw&rdquo;&mdash;he searched his
      bodyservant twice a day for poison, and drank nothing but vinegar and
      water (which he claimed were sovereign against the poison he was being
      fed).  He once had a grove of oaks chopped down because they were
      looking at him the wrong way, and then insisted that his troops give
      them decent burials and funerals as well.  However, he never lost a
      battle, so his insanity was tolerated.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aviendha">Aviendha</A>, p. 82 (101)&mdash;Aiel of
      the Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel.  Formerly a Maiden of the
      Spear, she was forced to give up the spear to become a Wise One because
      she had the ability to channel inborn.  She has green eyes, and is of
      age with <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> and <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>.  She is
      more than pretty with dark, reddish hair.  Aviendha is one of the three
      women in <A Href="#Min">Min</A>'s viewing of Rand&mdash;she also saw
      that she was to fall in love with him when she went through the three
      rings in Rhuidean.  She denied her feelings for him at first, but when
      the wagons crossed the Dragonwall toward Cairhien, sweat tents became
      unavailable and she tried bathing as &ldquo;wetlanders&rdquo; did; Rand
      came in as she was standing before the bath in her skin, and she
      panicked.  She created a Traveling gateway to Seanchan (she does not
      remember how), trying to get as far away from Rand as possible, into the
      middle of winter.  When Rand rescued her, she decided she could not hide
      her feelings any longer, and the two ended up spending the night in
      each other's arms before coming back.  Aviendha says a similar incident
      will not occur, and punishes any Maiden who makes a crack about it (how
      they found out about something that occurred on the far side of the
      world on another continent is a different subject entirely).  She feels
      <I>toh</I> toward <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> for violating her trust,
      and denies her feelings for Rand until she can make it up to Elayne.
      She is often needled by the Maidens about liking Rand's eyebrows.

      honey-colored hair, and grew up in Tarabon.  Her blue-gray eyes seem to
      constantly look startled.  Nothing seems to surprise her, though, and
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> thinks she would not believe the sun would
      come up unless she saw it herself, and if one morning it did not, she

      despite not being part of the Hall of the Tower.

      of the cooks in Salidar.  She dreamed her way into <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>

      (201)&mdash;Essentially the secretary to the
      <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>.  The Keeper is traditionally chosen
      from the same Ajah the Amyrlin was raised from, and wears a stole of the
      color of her Ajah instead of the striped stole of the Amyrlin.  The post
      was held by <A Href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</A> of the Blue Ajah until a
      coup deposed <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> and stilled both Siuan

      Typical of most Whites, she has a very cool, collected personality.  She
      serves as <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A> under
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>, despite being of a different Ajah than
      Elaida was raised from.  Elaida was all but forced to choose Alviarin in
      order to gain the support of the White Ajah when bringing charges against
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A>.  Without Alviarin as Keeper, the White Ajah
      would most likely have been divided over whether to depose Siuan, and
      only the Red would be behind Elaida, which would most likely have led to
      the stilling of Elaida and possibly even the dismantling of the Red Ajah.

      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>'s group of followers and advisors that
      deposed <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A>.  She is young, but is nonetheless
      the typical Brown, often slight and seemingly lost in her own thoughts.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Roedran">Roedran Almaric do Arreloa
      a'Naloy</A>, p. 155 (208)&mdash;King of Murandy, at least in name.
      In reality, Murandians hold allegiance to lords only, and those lords
      often refuse to pay their taxes to the King.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alliandre">Alliandre Maritha
      Kigarin</A>, p. 155 (208)&mdash;Blessed of the Light, Queen of
      Ghealdan.  She is the fourth person to sit on the throne of Ghealdan in
      the past seven months.  She wears jewelry to her meetings with
      <A Href="#Masema">Masema</A> for the sole purpose of giving it to him
      such that he won't ask for anything more; she also sent a letter to

      help.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Tylin">Tylin Quintara Mitsobar</A>, p. 155
      (208)&mdash;By the Grace of the Light, Queen of Altara.  Her kingdom
      is small, and she only rules a portion of it; the rest is governed by
      nobles not necessarily loyal to her.  She is the second from her House
      to sit on the throne&mdash;this is the maximum traditionally, and the
      only House to hold it for four generations fell so fast from power that
      it could not recover.  She is advised by

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Shemerin">Shemerin</A>, p. 155
      (208)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Yellow Ajah, reduced to Accepted by
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A> against all Tower law.  She ran away from
      the Tower after being reduced.  Shemerin was one of the Aes Sedai who

      office.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Farstrider">Jain Farstrider</A>, p. 157

      never has.  The book is quite popular with his friends, including

      spotted the Yellow Ajah's signal outside her shop, and when she and

      (228)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Red Ajah who approached

      an attempt to rescue him, an attempt which met with extreme failure.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Theodrin">Theodrin Dabei</A>, p. 172 (234)&mdash;A
      former Accepted in Salidar, now raised to something higher
      than Accepted but lower than a full Aes Sedai (due to the absence of the
      Oath Rod).  She is trying to dismantle <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>'s

      <!-- Theodrin Dabei, p. 481 -->
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Dagdara">Dagdara Finchey</A>, p. 173

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Nisao">Nisao Dachen</A>, p. 174
      (235)&mdash;Aes Sedai of Yellow Ajah.  Her eyes could drive nails.
      She specializes in the study of diseases of the mind, diseases which
      traditional Healing cannot touch.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Uno">Uno Nomesta</A>, p. 174 (236)&mdash;A
      Shienaran officer who accompanied the Emond's Fielders away from
      Shienar.  He is the one who gave orders to <A Href="#Masema">Masema</A>
      in the past.  He is missing one eye, has a long scar across his face,
      and has a hairstyle like the typical Shienaran warrior&mdash;a topknot
      tied together and the rest of the head shaved clean.  He is currently in
      Salidar with <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> and

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Thom">Thomdril (Thom) Merrilin</A>, p. 175
      (237)&mdash;A gleeman who came to Emond's Field on Winternight just
      before the Trollocs came.  He is quite the ladies' man.  Thom is good
      at juggling, sleight-of-hand, and all kinds of other tricks.  He also
      carries several concealed knives up his sleeves, in his boots, and in
      various other locations on his body; this practice seems to have spread
      from Thom to <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>, <A Href="#Min">Min</A>, and
      <A Href="#Faile">Faile</A>.  Thom was originally a bard in
      <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A>'s Royal Court, and for a time after
      her husband <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</A> died, he was the
      Queen's lover.  During his run from a Fade at Shadar Logoth, he was
      injured, and now walks with a limp because of it.  Thom is getting old,
      such that he is starting to realize that he can't do the backflips and
      other stunts he used to do.  He accompanied <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>
      and <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> on their travels as per
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>'s request, despite the fact that he has
      never felt comfortable around Aes Sedai since his nephew,
      <A Href="#Owyn">Owyn</A>, was gentled by the Red Ajah.  Thom is an expert
      in the Game of Houses; in fact, his girlfried Dena was killed by
      Cairhienin soldiers because they thought he was trying to play <I>Daes
      Daemar</I> against the Royal House.  <I>See also</I>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Juilin">Juilin Sandar</A>, p. 175

      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> on their travels because
      <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A> asked him to.  He accepted partly out of respect
      for Lan, and partly out of guilt; he betrayed Elayne,
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>, and Nynaeve to the Black Ajah when
      <A Href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</A> used Compulsion on him, and later
      realized how wrong it was.  He carries a notched sword-breaker and a
      staff with which he is deadly.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Tabiya">Tabiya</A>, p. 175 (238)&mdash;Green-eyed,
      freckle-faced novice of about sixteen.  She is part of
      the class that <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> teaches (the class went
      poorly).  She is one of the eighteen novices that were snatched up and
      brought to Salidar.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Nicola">Nicola Treehill</A>, p.
      175 (238)&mdash;Slender, black-haired, dark-eyed novice; she is about

      <!-- She can see ta'veren and has the Foretelling. -->
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Charel">Charel</A>, p. 176

      <A Href="#Sheriam">Sheriam</A> arranged for him to meet Theodrin in the

      novice lessons so she could channel at all.  Later, his twin sister
      <A Href="Marel">Marel</A> was substituted without Theodrin's knowledge;
      after she was revealed, Theodrin could channel whenever she wanted.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Marel">Marel</A>, p. 176

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Tarna">Tarna Feir</A>, p. 179 (244)&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Red Ajah.  She has pale yellow hair and blue eyes that
      could freeze the Sun.  She was a wilder, and had her block beaten out of
      her by <A Href="#Galina">Galina Casban</A>.  <I>Note:  Tarna says at one
      point that Galina &ldquo;knew [her] Ajah long before [she] did, and took
      a personal interest in [her].&rdquo;  This is just speculation, but I
      think it was the Black (not Red) Ajah that Galina knew she would choose.
      It certainly fits with the idea of most Aes Sedai in the Tower being
      Black, and with Galina's personal interest in Tarna.  Again, it's just
      speculation....</I>
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Faolain">Faolain Orande</A>, p.
      179 (244)&mdash;Dark, curly-haired Accepted.  She has an extreme dislike
      for Wilders, and does not treat <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A> and
      <A Href="#Leane">Leane</A>, who were stilled, very well either.  She
      spent eight years as a novice, and five among the Accepted.  She has
      since been raised to something more than Accepted, but still less than a
      full sister (due to the absence of the Oath Rod).

      her other, <A Href="#Owein">Owein</A>, died in the Two Rivers while

      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A>, and <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> should be
      bonded as Warders to &ldquo;keep an eye on them,&rdquo; but <I>says</I>,
      &ldquo;I am not so lost to custom yet as to bond a man against his will.
      Not quite yet.&rdquo;  This appears to have changed, however, since one
      of the first things she did after seeing Rand was to bond him.  She
      later found that bonding Rand was a grievious error; not only is it
      impossible to compel him in comparison to most Warders (she compared it
      to attempting to uproot a tree with her bare hands), but she constantly

      encountered the spirit of <A Href="#Mordeth">Mordeth</A> in Aridhol, now
      called Shadar Logoth.  Mordeth attempted to consume Fain's soul, but
      instead the two souls merged, producing something more evil than either
      of them alone.  Fain no longer takes his orders from the Shadow; he has
      his own evil agenda.  He has used his Mordeth-derived powers to spread
      suspicion of <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</> to
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida a'Roihan</A>, the <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin
      Seat</A> in Tar Valon, and <A Href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</A>, Lord
      Captain Commander of the Children of the Light.  <!-- Page 408, LoC -->
      It is said, &ldquo;The look of the Eyeless is
      fear,&rdquo; from observing that a Myrddraal's look causes fear in the
      hearts of men.  Fain's look has that effect on Myrddraal&mdash;Fades
      feel the same fear of Fain as men feel from a Fade.  Fain is also called
      <A Href="#Ordeith">Ordeith</A>, a name he adopted to become a Whitecloak

      Red Ajah before turning to the Black, but her oath to the Black was
      sworn before even being raised to the Accepted (perhaps before she came
      to the Tower), so it cannot really be said that she was ever Red Ajah at

      Laman and took his sword.  Because of Laman's Pride, and his Sin, House

      almost five hundred years later it was almost forgotten that it
      <I>was</I> a gift from them.  The tree, which grew in the center of the

      respect the Aiel held for the Cairhienin, as well as the passage
      through the Waste they were allowed, was terminated after Laman's

      adopted due to the chaos the resulted during the Trolloc Wars and the
      resulting confusion as to which year it actually was under the Toman
      Calendar.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aven"><I>Avendesora</I></A>, p. 704&mdash;The
      Legendary Tree of Life.  It is the last surviving Chora
      tree, and is located in Rhuidean.  The Tree was severely damaged
      when <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> and <A Href="#Asmodean">Asmodean</A>
      battled over control of the <I>ter'angreal</I> statue and destroyed
      the shielding on Rhuidean, but it is still alive and will send out
      shoots again.  A cutling of the Tree was given to the people of
      Cairhien as a sign of goodwill from the Aiel over 500 years ago.  That
      Tree, <I><A Href="#Avendo">Avendoraldera</A></I>, grew in the center of
      the city of Cairhien until <A Href="#Laman">King Laman Damodred</A> cut
      it down to make a throne out of the wood.  Laman's Sin (as it is now
      called) brought four Aiel clans over the Spine of the World to kill

      of Legend bound to the Horn of Valere.  He is a swordsman, and
      is always linked to <A Href="#Birgitte">Birgitte</A> in the stories.
      Unlike his depiction in the stories (which say he is as handsome as
      Birgitte is beautiful), Gaidal Cain is one of the ugliest men that
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> has ever seen.  Just being around him
      makes Nynaeve uncomfortable.  Before being ripped out of
      <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>, Birgitte mentioned that she had not seen Gaidal
      around for some time, indicating that he has been spun out into the
      Pattern again.  She fears she will never see him again.  <I>See also</I>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Dark">Shai'tan</A>, p. 706&mdash;The Dark One,
      source of all evil, complete opposite of the
      <A Href="#Creator">Creator</A> in every way.  At the moment of Creation,
      the Dark One was imprisoned by the Creator at Shayol Ghul.  This prison
      kept the Dark One from touching the world until it was bored into by
      humans during the Age of Legends.  This hole, called the Bore, allowed
      the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new outbreaks of
      war, treachery, violence, and crime.  The attempt to free the Dark One
      completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the War of Power by
      some, especially those on the Shadow's side), during which a number of
      important leaders forsook the Light and gave their lives to the Dark
      One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of the
      most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  The War of the Shadow
      did not end until <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A>, the Dragon,
      and his Hundred Companions Traveled to Shayol Ghul and re-sealed the
      Dark One back into his prison.  At the moment of sealing, Shai'tan
      lashed out at those sealing the prison, driving them insane and tainting
      <I>saidin</I> itself, the male half of the True Source, dooming all male
      Aes Sedai to madness as well and starting the Time of Madness.  These
      seals are weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the
      Dark One is once again able to exert influence on the world.  These
      seals were scattered throughout the world by Aes Sedai during the
      Breaking of the World.  In order of when they were found, they were
      placed:  (1) At the Eye of the World (broken when it was found); (2) in
      the hands of <A Href="#Domon">Bayle Domon</A>, later pilfered by
      <A Href="#Turak">High Lord Turak</A> of the Seanchan (broke at the
      battle of Falme), (3) On Seanchan, part of High Lord Turak's collection
      (broken at the battle at Falme); (4) In the Great Hold at the Stone of
      Tear (still intact); (5) In the Panarch's Palace in Tanchico (broke
      enroute to Salidar); (6) One in Rhuidean (still intact), and (7) Found
      by <A Href="#Taim">Mazrim Taim</A> (still intact).  Despite being made
      of <I>cuendillar</I>, the three that remain unbroken can be cut with a
      knife and would break by a fall from a table.  The Dark One is also
      referred to by other Euphemisms, including Sightblinder, Lord of the
      Grave, Father of Lies, Grassburner, Leafblighter, Heartsbane, Soulsbane,
      Lord of the Twilight, Father of Storms, Shepherd of the Night, and
      (among Darkfriends) Great Lord of the Dark.

      714&mdash;Last Dreamer in the White Tower; an Aes Sedai of the Brown
      Ajah.  She died almost 400 years ago.  Almost all of the
      <I>ter'angreal</I> the Black Ajah stole from the Tower were last studied
      by her; they allow partial access to <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>, the World of
