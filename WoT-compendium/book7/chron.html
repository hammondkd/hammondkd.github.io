  <li><a class="name" id="Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>,
      p. 9 (ix)&mdash;According to the <i>Karaethon Cycle</i>, the Prophecies of the
      Dragon, the man who is the Rebirth of
      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>,
      the man known as the <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a> during the
      War of the Shadow.  Over the years, many men have claimed to be the
      Dragon Reborn, even men who could not channel.  The true Dragon has been
      Reborn in a young man named <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a>, a shepherd
      from Emond&rsquo;s Field.

  <li><a class="name" id="Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a&rsquo;Roihan</a>,
      p. 13 (1)&mdash;Aes Sedai formerly of the Red Ajah,
      now raised to the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>.  She was born the
      youngest daughter of a minor House in the north of Murandy.  Elaida
      served as advisor to <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a> of Andor for
      Morgase&rsquo;s entire reign, and she led the coup that deposed
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>
      and placed her on the Amyrlin Seat in Siuan&rsquo;s place.  Elaida
      distrusts anyone not of her Ajah (as most Reds do), and does not believe
      she will ever trust any member of the Blue Ajah again, even in the
      slightest.  Her <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a> is
      <a href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</a> of the White Ajah&mdash;she was
      all but forced to choose Alviarin due to her role in the
      deposition of Siuan.  If she had chosen a Keeper from her Ajah, she most
      likely would not have won the support of the White Ajah, and then
      <i>she</i> would have been stilled and banished from the Tower instead
      of Siuan.  She sometimes has the Foretelling, but not all that often or
      that strongly.  One of her Foretellings was that the Royal Family of
      Andor would play a crucial role in the Last Battle&mdash;this Foretelling
      occurred around the time the Succession was going on, so she immediately
      attached herself to Morgase as soon as it became clear that she would be
      the one to take the Lion Throne.  Another was to predict that
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a> would shake the world on its very
      foundations&mdash;she constantly kicks herself for not doing something
      about him when he was in front of her, little more than a farmboy at the
      time.  Her most recent Foretelling was that &ldquo;the White Tower would
      be whole again, except for remnants cast out and scorned, whole and
      stronger than ever.  <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a> will face the
      Amyrlin Seat and know her anger.  The Black Tower will be rent in blood
      and fire, and sisters will walk its grounds.&rdquo;  The Foretelling
      about Rand is obviously deadly accurate.  However, the one about the
      Royal Family occurred at an inopportune time: at the time of Elaida&rsquo;s
      Foretelling, the Royal Family was not certain.  It may have meant
      Morgase, <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>, <a href="#Galad">Galad</a>, and
      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> (they have all had a large role to play in
      the recent past), but it is also possible it could have meant the old
      Royal Family, that of Tigraine, Taringail,
      Galad, and later Elayne and Gawyn as well.  After all, Morgase is just
      Morgase, but Tigraine is the mother of the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.  Her most recent
      Foretelling will of course be fulfilled, but not necessarily how she
      wants it to be: she does not realize that the Amyrlin Seat in the
      Foretelling might not be herself, that the remnants cast out might be
      those loyal to her, and that the destruction of the Black Tower might
      have nothing to do with her.  Elaida is quite strong in the
      One Power: only Siuan, <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>,
      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>, <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a>,
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>, and a few others can match her strength.
      Elaida has always sought positions of power; she chose to follow Morgase
      to have a better chance at guiding the forces in the Last Battle, and she
      tried to capture Rand al&rsquo;Thor in an effort to gain similar control.  The
      only sisters that support her are those that are actually Black Ajah and
      those that would follow any Amyrlin legally raised, as Elaida was
      (although just barely: all laws used to raise her were stretched almost
      to their breaking point, and some believe they actually did shatter).
      Elaida is currently building a palace for herself atop the Warders&rsquo; old
      practice yard.  The building will be about as tall as the White
      Tower.

  <li><a class="name" id="Dark">Dark One</a>,
      p. 13 (1)&mdash;Name, used in every land, for Shai&rsquo;tan, the source of all evil,
      complete opposite of the <a href="#Creator">Creator</a> in every way.  At
      the moment of Creation, the Dark One was imprisoned by the Creator at
      Shayol Ghul.  This prison kept the Dark One from touching the world
      until it was bored into by humans during the Age of Legends.  This hole,
      called the Bore, allowed the Dark One to once again touch the world,
      causing new outbreaks of war, treachery, violence, and crime.  The
      attempt to free the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the
      Shadow (called the War of Power by some, especially those on the
      Shadow&rsquo;s side), during which a number of important leaders forsook the
      Light and gave their lives to the Dark One; these people are known today
      as the Forsaken, and were 13 of the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age
      of Legends.  The War of the Shadow did not end until
      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, the
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>, and his Hundred Companions Traveled to
      Shayol Ghul and re-sealed the Dark One back into his prison, trapping
      the Forsaken with him.  At the moment of sealing, Shai&rsquo;tan lashed out at
      those sealing the prison, driving them insane and tainting <i>saidin</i>
      itself, the male half of the True Source, dooming all male Aes Sedai to
      madness as well and starting the Time of Madness.  These seals are
      weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the Dark One is
      once again able to exert influence on the world.  These seals were
      scattered throughout the world by Aes Sedai during the Breaking of the
      World.  In order of when they were found, they were placed:  (1) At the
      Eye of the World (broken when it was found); (2) in the hands of
      Bayle Domon, later pilfered by
      High Lord Turak of the
      Seanchan (broken at the battle of Falme), (3) On Seanchan, part of High
      Lord Turak&rsquo;s collection (broken at the battle at Falme); (4) In the Great
      Hold at the Stone of Tear (still intact); (5) In the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace in
      Tanchico (broken enroute to Salidar); (6) One in Rhuidean (still intact),
      and (7) Found by <a href="#Taim">Mazrim Taim</a> on a small farm in
      Saldaea (still intact).  Despite being made of <i>cuendillar</i>, the
      three that remain unbroken can be cut with a knife and would break by a
      fall from a table.  The Dark One is also referred to by many euphemisms,
      including Sightblinder, Lord of the Grave, Father of Lies, Grassburner,
      Leafblighter, Heartsbane, Soulsbane, Lord of the Twilight, Father of
      Storms, Shepherd of the Night, and (among Darkfriends) the Great Lord of
      the Dark.

  <li><a class="name" id="Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>,
      p. 13 (2)&mdash;Leader of the Aes Sedai, their equivalent of a queen.
      She in theory holds supreme power amongst the sisters, and leads the Hall
      of the Tower at its meetings.  Kings and queens of nations strong and
      weak will come if summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their
      entire trip figuring out how they will put a knife in her back while
      there.  The Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the
      Power and in her character.  The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be
      unanimous, as must the vote to depose one.  Once chosen, the Amyrlin is
      said to be &ldquo;of all Ajahs and none&rdquo;&mdash;all previous
      affiliations with Ajah are ignored (at least in principle).
      The Ajahs have gotten fairly equal
      numbers of Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions:  no
      Amyrlin has been raised from the Red Ajah since
      Bonwhin Meraighdin, who was
      deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in
      <a href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a>&rsquo;s day, except for
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a&rsquo;Roihan</a>, the
      current Amyrlin Seat in Tar Valon; the Blue Ajah has had more than the
      average number of Amyrlins from its Ajah&mdash;four of the last the last
      five Amyrlins (before Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah.  These two
      exceptions to the mean number of Amyrlins from one&rsquo;s Ajah have only
      added to the friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years.
      The Amyrlin has a secretary of sorts, the
      <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>,
      who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the
      Amyrlin was raised from.  The office was held by
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>, raised from the Blue Ajah,
      until she was deposed for her involvement with events surrounding the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.
      Her successor was the leader of the coup,
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a&rsquo;Roihan</a>, raised from the Red
      Ajah.  Siuan&rsquo;s deposition divided the Tower, and the faction opposing
      Elaida raised a new Amyrlin who could not be accused of choosing sides
      on the day Siuan was deposed:  <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al&rsquo;Vere</a>, who
      was outside the Tower and not even a full sister from the time Siuan was
      deposed to the time Egwene was Raised.

      disbelief when Elaida told him her palace was to have a spire ten spans
      higher than the Tower itself.  However, being that it is Elaida he is

  <li><a class="name" id="Cemaile">Cemaile Sorenthaine</a>,

      years ago.  In memory of the days before the Trolloc Wars when no ruler
      held a throne without the White Tower&rsquo;s approval, she had a gilded clock
      commissioned.  The clock was taken down and forgotten in storage after
      she died, and it did not reappear until <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a> put
      it back up when she was raised.

      She led the expedition to bring <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> to Tar
      Valon after he was shielded. She was captured by the Shaido after the
      battle at Dumai&rsquo;s Wells.
      Galina has long black hair without a touch of gray in it.

  <li><a class="name" id="Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a>,
      p. 16 (5)&mdash;A young man from Emond&rsquo;s Field in the Two Rivers, now proclaimed
      to be the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>.  He is very tall, with
      curly red-blond hair.  He was raised by <a href="#Tam">Tam al&rsquo;Thor</a>
      and his wife Kari (until her death around the time
      Rand was five) in Emond&rsquo;s Field.  His real parents, however, were
      Janduin, the chief of the Taardad Aiel who brought the four
      clans across the Dragonwall to punish <a href="#Laman">Laman</a>&rsquo;s Sin, and
      a Maiden of the Spear named Shaiel, who was actually
      Tigraine Mantear, the runaway
      <a href="#DH">Daughter-Heir of Andor</a>.  Tigraine gave
      birth to Rand on the slopes of Dragonmount, in accordance with prophecy:
      &ldquo;born of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the Old.&rdquo;
      Rand has a heron branded into each of his palms, which he received from
      the sword Tam gave him while fighting <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a>.
      He also has two dragons on his forearms, which he recieved in Rhuidean
      to designate him
      as the <i><a href="#Caracarn">Car&rsquo;a&rsquo;carn</a></i>, the Chief of Chiefs of
      the Aiel.  He is not only the Dragon Reborn, but also
      He Who Comes With the Dawn,
      the man prophesied to reunite the Aiel, and
      the <a href="#Coramoor">Coramoor</a>, the one prophesied to bring the Sea
      Folk out of the Sea.  He can channel strongly, more so than any person
      who ever lived (except the previous user of his soul,
      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, who was obviously of equal
      strength), and is also <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i>, the most strongly so since Lews
      Therin as well.  Lews Therin&rsquo;s voice has somehow found a new place inside
      of Rand&rsquo;s head; he talks to him in a mad voice when Rand least expects
      it, sometimes offering sound advice or knowledge, sometimes babbling,
      sometimes even trying to wrest control of <i>saidin</i> from him.
      Unlike Lews Therin, Rand is accompanied by two other <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i>
      during this turing of the Wheel, two men born within days
      (hours, even) of him named <a href="#Mat">Matrim Cauthon</a> and
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>, who both grew up in Emond&rsquo;s Field as
      well.  Rand is destined to fall in love with three women (and has):
      <a href="#Min">Min Farshaw</a>, <a href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</a>, and
      <a href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</a>.  Rand has had success in fighting many
      of the Forsaken; all to confront him have died or been trapped.  He
      killed <a href="#Aginor">Aginor</a> at the Eye of
      the World after the Green Man
      killed <a href="#Balthamel">Balthamel</a>; he allowed <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> to kill
      <a href="#Belal">Be&rsquo;lal</a> in the Stone of Tear, and he killed
      <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a> in the Stone shortly afterward; in the
      wagons near the Spine of the World, <a href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</a>
      confronted him and was pushed into the land of the Eelfinn by Moiraine;
      he killed <a href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</a> in <i>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</i> when he
      came to the Royal Palace in Caemlyn; and
      <a href="#Asmodean">Asmodean</a>, his teacher, was killed shortly after
      Rahvin met his fate.  His prophecies fulfilled grow:  he has already been
      born on the slopes of Dragonmount of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but
      raised by the old, taken the Stone of Tear and drawn <i>Callandor</i>,
      and began conquering &ldquo;under the forgotten symbol,&rdquo; that of
      the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  He is working on having the
      &ldquo;spotless tower&rdquo; break and bend knee to him (several Aes
      Sedai have sworn fealty to him and only him).
      He is the salvation of the entire world, and as the prophecy states,
      he <i>will</i> save the world&mdash;and Break it again.

  <li><a class="name" id="Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</a>,
      p. 17 (6)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the White Ajah, but secretly the head of the Black
      Ajah.  She was chosen to head the Black Ajah after the previous leader,
      <a href="#Jarna">Jarna Malari</a>,
      was killed by <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a> after she managed to kill
      off the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a> without Ishamael&rsquo;s approval.
      Typical of most Whites, she has a very cool, collected personality.
      She serves as <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>
      under <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a>, despite being of a
      different Ajah than Elaida was raised from.  Elaida was all but forced
      to choose Alviarin in order to gain the support of the White Ajah when
      bringing charges against <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a>; unknown to
      Elaida, this also brought her the support of the Black Ajah.  Without
      Alviarin as Keeper, the White Ajah would most likely have been divided
      over whether to depose Siuan, and only the Red would be behind Elaida,
      which would most likely have led to the stilling of Elaida and possibly
      even the dismantling of the Red Ajah.  It still may, since Elaida is
      rapidly losing her power to Alviarin&mdash;and if Alviarin&rsquo;s loyalties
      are ever revealed, nothing will save either of them.

  <li><a class="name" id="Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>,
      p. 17 (6)&mdash;Essentially the secretary to the
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>.  The Keeper is traditionally chosen
      from the same Ajah the Amyrlin was raised from, and wears a stole of the
      color of her Ajah instead of the striped stole of the Amyrlin.  The post
      was held by <a href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</a> of the Blue Ajah until a
      coup deposed <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> and stilled both Siuan and
      Leane.  Her successor was <a href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</a> of
      the White Ajah, despite the fact that Siuan&rsquo;s successor was from the Red.
      The Keeper for the Aes Sedai who fled the Tower when
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a> was raised Amyrlin now have a Keeper of the
      Chronicles of their own, <a href="#Sheriam">Sheriam Bayanar</a> of the
      Blue Ajah.  In theory, the Keeper of the Chronicles serves the Amyrlin
      and speaks for the Amyrlin; she is all but separate from her Ajah,
      although less so than the Amyrlin Seat herself.  However, both of the
      current Keepers have tried to expand their powers over the Amyrlin they
      serve, although for vastly different reasons&mdash;Alviarin is
      essentially trying to weaken Elaida and have herself or another Black
      sister raised in her place after Elaida is deposed; Sheriam tries to
      overstep <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> because she has a hard time thinking of
      Egwene being anything more than the frightened novice that came to her
      study not so long ago.

      p. 18 (8)&mdash;Born in Tear to a fisherman,
      she was sent to the White Tower on the
      first boat to leave after she discovered she had the ability to channel
      inborn, according to Tairen law.  As a novice, she was good friends with
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine Damodred</a>, and was present at
      Gitara Moroso&rsquo;s Foretelling of the Rebirth of the
      <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>.  After being raised to the shawl, she
      joined the Blue Ajah to dedicate her life to finding and guiding the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>, and eventually came
      to lead the Blues&rsquo; network of eyes-and-ears (i.e., spies) before being
      raised to the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>.  She was only thirty
      years old when raised to the Amyrlin Seat, making her the youngest
      Amyrlin to date.  She was also one of the strongest Amyrlins in recent
      history, and one of the most feared among the rulers of nations.  Her
      blue-eyed stare was feared by all.  When her twenty-year connection to
      the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> was discovered, she and her
      <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>,
      <a href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</a>,
      were deposed and stilled by a group of sisters loyal to
      <a href="#Elaida">Elaida a&rsquo;Roihan</a>.  Siuan hoped to regain some of her
      previous standing in the new Tower that separated from Elaida&mdash;her
      knowledge of the Blue Ajah spy network is hard to match, and she knows
      much that she thinks would be of use.  In one of her viewings,
      <a href="#Min">Min</a> saw that Siuan would have to remain close by to
      <a href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</a>&mdash;if she did not, both of them
      would die.  Siuan did not initially know what she meant, but now
      realizes that she is growing to love the gray-haired man who leads the
      Salidar army.  She had a Warder named <a href="#Alric">Alric</a>, but he died
      when she was deposed.  After coming to Salidar, <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>
      discovered how to restore Siuan&rsquo;s ability to channel, at least partially.
      This resurrected a part of her bond with Alric, but did not bring back
      her former strength, or her binding by the Oath Rod.  She can now lie as
      well as any child.  She now serves as an &ldquo;advisor&rdquo; to the
      new Amyrlin in Salidar, <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al&rsquo;Vere</a>, but though
      she puts on a
      fa&ccedil;ade of hating the work, she is actually one of Egwene&rsquo;s
      foremost agents.  The fact that she is Aes Sedai, not to mention one who
      was stilled and Healed again, makes other sisters tend to be oblivious to
      this fact.

      p. 18 (8)&mdash;A young woman from Emond&rsquo;s Field, now an Aes Sedai of the Yellow
      Ajah.  She was the Wisdom of her village, the youngest such ever chosen
      in Emond&rsquo;s Field.  She left when four of her villagers were taken away
      from the Two Rivers by <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> and
      <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>.  While the group traveled away from her home and
      toward her new life, Nynaeve made several discoveries:  she could channel
      the One Power, and had already done so without really knowing what she
      was doing; she developed feelings for al&rsquo;Lan Mandragoran, Moiraine&rsquo;s
      Warder and the uncrowned king of the now dead nation Malkier; and she has
      a major role to play, as all of her younger friends in the group do, in
      the years to come.  She is very strong in the One Power: only a select
      few who were alive during the Age of Legends could match her.  When she
      arrived in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a
      novice, despite not being able to even <i>sense</i> the True Source
      unless angry, a result of her having to learn some minimal control of her
      ability without teaching.  She was sent on a false mission by
      <a href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</a> on which she was almost leashed by the
      Seanchan as <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> was.  After she returned to the
      Tower, <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a> sent her on a mission to hunt
      down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in
      Tanchico, she encountered <a href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</a> and managed
      to better her in a duel of the Power.  Moghedien escaped, but two
      encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her,
      leashing her with an <i>a&rsquo;dam</i> in <i>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</i>.  Nynaeve
      took Moghedien with her to seek out <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> and
      <a href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</a> while they were fighting each other, and at the last
      moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin to ash
      with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could draw
      to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain control of
      himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire.  Nynaeve then kept Moghedien
      under control with a modified <i>a&rsquo;dam</i> in Salidar.  Nynaeve wished
      to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she thinks the
      Tower meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and wants no part
      of it.  She is determined to Heal anything short of death,
      and has already managed to Heal gentling.
      Nynaeve felt bad when Moiraine died, because her first thought was not
      of her, but that now Lan was free from their bond.
      She was not told that Lan&rsquo;s bond had been passed to
      <a href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</a> the moment of Moiraine&rsquo;s death.

      <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>.  She married
      Taringail Damodred, a prince of Cairhien,
      to further solidify her claim to the
      Throne of Andor and keep peace between the two nations; when
      Tigraine disappeared, Morgase made the best
      claim to succeed her, and married her widower to gain the support that
      would be gained by such action.  Taringail was Elayne&rsquo;s and Gawyn&rsquo;s
      father; he died when they were young.  Morgase
      has since gone through several lovers, including
      <a href="#Thom">Thomdril Merrilin</a>,

      stilled the riots in Caemlyn that sprang up on Morgase&rsquo;s trip to Tar
      Valon to inquire about Elayne&rsquo;s whereabouts.  Thom was exiled from the
      city of Caemlyn when he started telling her what he really thought of
      some of her plans, her relationship with Bryne ebbed away until finally
      Gaebril told her to exile him too, and Gaebril eventually chased Morgase
      herself out of the city when she found he was usurping her power.  The
      Daughter-Heir of Andor is traditionally trained by Aes Sedai in the
      White Tower, and Morgase underwent novice training to keep the tradition
      alive.  She was given the gift of a Great Serpent ring despite not being
      Accepted, and still wears it on her left hand.  She was previously
      advised by <a href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a&rsquo;Roihan</a> of the Red
      Ajah, who is now the <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a> in Tar Valon.

      back to her, not to mention believes that she is dead.  If she made her
      presence known, she would no doubt have her country back in one piece
      and all would be well, but as royalty she believes she must work on her
      own and trust no one.  The entire world believes Morgase dead except for
      a select few, all of which are in Amadicia at the moment.  Her sign is
      three golden keys.

      500 years; she trained with the Wise Ones to learn more of this Talent.
      Egwene is good friends with <a href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</a>, the
      Daughter-Heir of Andor, and is also a childhood friend
      of <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a>, the Dragon Reborn.  In fact, Rand
      and Egwene were all but Promised in their youth, but both of them feels
      an almost sibling-like love for each other now; they know that they
      cannot get married, and don&rsquo;t really want to.  Egwene is the love object
      of both of Elayne&rsquo;s brothers, <a href="#Galad">Galad</a> and
      <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a>&mdash;she is flattered by Galad&rsquo;s attentions, but
      she does not return them; she does find Gawyn to her liking, and had a
      dream of bonding him as her Warder; she knows it will occur.  Egwene was
      most likely chosen Amyrlin because the Aes Sedai thought she could be
      guided by them without too much trouble; if this was their intent, they
      made a grave mistake, for Egwene promises to be one of the strongest
      Amyrlins in history.

      p. 24 (15)&mdash;Former First Prince of the Sword and Captain of the Queen&rsquo;s
      Guards under <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a> in Andor.
      He was appointed
      to the position because Morgase had no living male relatives, but was
      exiled from Caemlyn on a suggestion from Morgase&rsquo;s new advisor,
      <a href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</a>.  He moved to his private estates
      in rural Andor, where he presided over the trial of three young women
      who unintentionally burned a barn: they turned out to be
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>, the former
      <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>;
      <a href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</a>, the former
      <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>, and
      <a href="#Min">Min Farshaw</a>.  When these three made an oath to serve
      him and then apparently broke it, he followed them out of sheer
      curiosity to Salidar.  Once their, he discovered the true identity of the
      three, as well as that the Tower was truly broken.  The Aes Sedai in
      Salidar persuaded him to command the army they would need to take the
      Amyrlin Seat from <a href="#Elaida">Elaida</a>, since he was the only
      commander that the Warders thought would be willing and able to help
      them.  He is one of the six best military commanders west of the Aiel
      Waste, in a league with <a href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</a>,
      Rodel Ituralde,
      <a href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</a>,
      Agelmar Jagad, and
      <a href="#Mat">Matrim Cauthon</a>.  Although neither of them would admit
      it, Bryne seems to be developing feelings for Siuan Sanche; he wishes to
      avoid another mistake like his relationship as
      <a href="#Morgase">Morgase</a>&rsquo;s lover, and also never forgave Siuan for
      when she publicly shamed him years ago.  She seems to be developing
      similar feelings for him, much to her dismay.  He plans to be the first
      ever general to take the city of Tar Valon; the closest anyone else ever
      came was with <a href="#Guaire">Guaire Amalasan</a>&rsquo;s armies, who got as
      far as the White Tower itself, and
      <a href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a>,
      who never managed to go beyond beseiging the city.
      Actually, Amalasan&rsquo;s troops never beseiged the city, they simply managed
      to breech the walls; Hawkwing never managed to stop the supply ships
      coming up the river.  Bryne believes he will be able to overcome this
      problem.

      seductive ways of Domani women, Leane found that her life would take a
      different direction:  she could channel <i>saidar</i>, and would do so
      with or without teaching.  She became an Aes Sedai, a member of the Blue
      Ajah, and was eventually raised to
      <a href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</a>
      under <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>.  During the coup

      thrown in the dungeon and stilled.  Leane tried turning to her seductive
      side to try to replace what she lost in stilling; she was out of
      practice, but did well enough.  She eventually convinced the Aes Sedai
      in Salidar to let her stay with them and maintain the network of
      eyes-and-ears she kept in Tar Valon as Keeper.  She was later Healed by
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>, and restored to some of her former
      capacity for using the One Power.  The Hall of the Tower in Salidar
      decided that since she had been stilled, she was no longer Aes Sedai for
      that time and thus all of her titles and choice of Ajah were null and
      void.  Instead of petitioning to re-enter the Blue Ajah, she asked the
      Green Ajah if it would accept her; it did.

  <li><a class="name" id="Lanfear">Lanfear</a>,

      Forsaken.  Unlike the rest of the Forsaken, she chose her name for
      herself, which means &ldquo;Daughter of the Night&rdquo; in the Old
      Tongue.  She was born Mierin Eronaile,
      and was strong in the One Power.  She worked at the Collam Daan,
      the primary facility for research into the One Power.
      Her final discovery there was what she
      thought was a new source for the One Power, one that could be harnessed
      by men and women alike&mdash;this source turned out to be the emissions
      through a thin spot in the Pattern from the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>&rsquo;s prison.
      She and another Aes Sedai named Beidomon bored into
      the prison, creating what is now referred to as simply the Bore,
      allowing the Dark One to touch the world again and leading to the War of
      the Shadow.  Around this time, Mierin formed a relationship with
      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>, who headed the forces of the
      Light against the Shadow and was the most powerful man she had found.
      Lews Therin broke off the relationship when he found that she only
      wanted him for his power and authority and the possibility of power for
      herself through him.  Mierin never let go of him, and when he later met
      and married Ilyena Moerelle, she tried to disrupt
      the wedding ceremony as well as split the two apart by any means.
      Eventually she went to Shayol Ghul to dedicate her soul to the Shadow,
      most likely to finally get back at Lews Therin for leaving her.  She
      declared as her territory the World of Dreams, <i>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</i>,
      using it to ends now unknown.  She transferred her obsessive love intact
      to Lews Therin&rsquo;s soul&rsquo;s new body, <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a>,
      after being freed from the Bore.  She first appeared to him as a young
      woman named Selene, but disguised her appearance as a slightly less
      beautiful (but still stunning) woman.  Almost a year later, Lanfear
      found that Rand had been &ldquo;unfaithful&rdquo; to her, and she tried
      to kill him.  Before she could, she was pushed through the twisted stone
      doorway <i>ter&rsquo;angreal</i> leading to the lands of the Eelfinn by
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>, becoming trapped.  It is not known
      whether Lanfear is still alive.

  <li><a class="name" id="Graendal">Graendal</a>,
      p. 40 (37)&mdash;One of the Forsaken.  A fleshy woman with curled red-gold hair.
      Before the War of the Shadow, she became the leading authority on
      diseases of the brain, and spent much of her life dealing with the
      insane, schizophrenic, and others well beyond the touch of Healing.  She
      was the best at subtle manipulations of the human mind that ever lived.
      After the Bore was drilled, she went through a change after she realized
      the world could never live up to her standards.  So she began dressing in
      the very way she once mocked, with low cut dresses that clung to her and
      left little to the imagination.  After being released from the Bore,
      Graendal took up residence in Arad Doman, capturing several members of
      the Royal Family to use as servants.  All of her servants are not only
      physically well shaped and good-looking, but also had power in their
      society before she captured them.  She includes in her collection the
      sister of the Domani king, two rulers from Shara, and other important
      figures.  She has been working with <a href="#Sammael">Sammael</a> in the

      of the Forsaken.  After being released from the Bore, he took up
      residence in Tear as the High Lord Samon.  He was killed by
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> in the Stone of Tear, just before
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> took <i>Callandor</i>.  He had white hair at his
      temples, and was a Blademaster.  Since he was destroyed by balefire, he

  <li><a class="name" id="Ishamael">Ishamael</a>,
      p. 40 (38)&mdash;One of the Forsaken.  He was the most powerful of the Forsaken,
      and during the Age of Legends he was a prominent philosopher and
      theologian named Elan Morin Tedronai.
      He was never really bound inside the Bore,
      and led the hidden forces of the Shadow for the three thousand odd years
      from the end of the War of the Shadow to the present.  He took credit
      for such things as convincing the then insane
      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a> to kill everyone he loved,
      pursuading the dying
      <a href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a> not to accept the Aes Sedai
      Healing that might have saved his life, sending the Trollocs out of the
      Great Blight during the Trolloc Wars, and many other events in history
      that turned out poorly.  When the rest of the Forsaken were freed,
      Ishamael kept them away from eachother&rsquo;s throats.  He confronted
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> at the Eye of the World where he was severed
      from the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>&rsquo;s bonds; he confronted him again at
      Falme where Rand put his sword through him and melted it, but not
      after Ishamael gave Rand a wound that he has not been able to recover
      from yet; and he confronted Rand in the Stone of Tear after he took
      <i>Callandor</i>.  Rand killed Ishamael after beating him sore by
      plunging <i>Callandor</i> into his heart.  His body rotted quickly, but
      it was proof that Ba&rsquo;alzamon, which he called himself
      to the public, was a human being, and not the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>.
      However, death is not always final with the Dark One; with the
      appearance of two other Foraken presumed dead, it is likely that
      Ishamael has been resurrected as well.

      no one could get near her, only listen to her scream. Jarna&rsquo;s public
      fa&ccedil;ade was as a model of virtue; when her remains could be

      the Forsaken.  During the Age of Legends, she was one of the best
      Healers ever known.  She was called to all corners of the world Heal
      people that others thought beyond help.  However, she was sadistic; she
      exacted a price in the form of pain from her subjects in return for her
      Healing services.  Most thought the pain or anguish she exacted from
      them was a small price to pay for being alive, but eventually the Hall
      of Servants found out about her practices and gave her the choice of
      being severed or bound with the Power, never again to know her
      &ldquo;pleasures.&rdquo;  She chose instead to pledge for the
      <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>, and created one of the most oppressive and
      pain-filled areas of Shadow control during the entire War of Power.
      After being freed from the Bore, Semirhage went in service to the Dark
      One by extracting information from captured Borderlanders and Aes Sedai.
      She also sent the Trollocs to the Stone of Tear to battle those that

      p. 43 (41)&mdash;One of the Forsaken.  He has a hawk-like nose and dark hair.
      Second-best seems to be the story of his life.  He was born
      Barid Bel Medar one day after
      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>,
      and from the first day proceeded to almost equal Lews Therin&rsquo;s
      accomplishments, almost equal Lews Therin&rsquo;s strength, and almost
      equal him but never surpass him in everything.  He became one of the
      Light&rsquo;s greatest generals, once again second in command under Lews
      Therin.  Demandred believed that he was Lews Therin&rsquo;s intellectual and
      military superior, and was furious when Lews Therin was chosen to lead
      the Light&rsquo;s forces over him during the War of the Shadow.  He developed
      a burning hatred of Lews Therin, and finally dedicated his life to the
      Shadow so he could finally better Lews Therin&mdash;he believed the
      Shadow would eventually win the war since Lews Therin was commanding the
      Light&rsquo;s armies, and that if he, Barid Bel Medar, had been chosen to
      command them, the Light would have prevailed.  When Demandred was freed
      from the Bore, he transferred his hatred of Lews Therin to the new
      recipient of his soul, <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a>.  Demandred was
      recently told by the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> to lead his plan to

  <li><a class="name" id="Niall">Pedron Niall</a>,

      He is one of the great military commanders in the

      Agelmar Jagad, Rodel Ituralde,
      <a href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</a>, <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>, and
      several Aiel chiefs.  He was trying to get Altara and Murandy to cede
      land to Illian so the Council of Nine would not invade both countries.
      He also tried to expand Amadicia&rsquo;s borders into parts of Ghealdan.  His
      headquarters is in Amadicia, and he ruled there even above
      <a href="#Ailron">King Ailron</a>, although this was not spoken of
      openly.  Niall recently offered a treaty with
      <a href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</a> of Andor,
      offering Whitecloak assistance to retake her throne in exchange
      for Whitecloak presence in Caemlyn and elsewhere in Andor, a presence
      that Morgase had not allowed even a fraction of during her reign.  Niall
      was killed by his alleged Spymaster, <a href="#Omerna">Abdel Omerna</a>,
      who claimed he had gone against everything the Children stood for by
      allowing Morgase to avoid being put to the question.  He was replaced by

      when Elayne becomes Queen.  He and his half-brother
      <a href="#Galad">Galad</a> went to train with the Warders in the White Tower,
      as all sons of Andoran queens have for centuries, and both now possess
      considerable skill with the sword.  During the chaos that erupted after
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>&rsquo;s deposition, Gawyn formed a band
      of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders except Galad,
      who are called the Younglings.  The Younglings fought back against their
      teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and <a href="#Leane">Leane</a>
      from their imprisonment.  Gawyn himself killed Hammar and Coulin,
      the men in charge of teaching the sword and for his personal training,
      respectively, both of which were Blademasters&mdash;few Warders are as
      good as they were, and Gawyn managed to kill both of them.  With recent
      developments, Gawyn does not know which party to support&mdash;he
      believes that anyone who opposed Tower Law by trying to free Siuan and
      Leane was wrong, but at the same time he does not know all the facts
      surrounding the change in leadership.
      In fact, his sister Elayne and her friends

      <a href="#Egwene">Egwene al&rsquo;Vere</a>
      side with those who broke from the Tower, and Egwene, the woman he wants
      to marry, is their new leader.  He believes the rumor that

      trouble blushing when she speaks to him, and Aes Sedai would often
      forsake their work to watch him practice (shirtless) in the sword yard.
      Galad has much skill with the sword, and has achieved Blademaster status
      in practice if not in name.  He disappeared from Tar Valon during the
      violence that accompanied <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a>&rsquo;s deposition and joined
      <a href="#Valda">Eamon Valda</a>&rsquo;s band of the Children of the Light.
      Because of his sword skill,
      Galad was promoted to an official position very quickly, and now
      controls his own small band of men.  He says he became a Whitecloak
      because it &ldquo;felt right.&rdquo; He is extremely virtuous,
      and will do whatever he thinks is right regardless of who it hurts,
      even himself.  His sign is a winged silver sword, point down.
      Galad has feelings for

      Min does not always know what these viewings mean, but when she does, it
      <i>will</i> happen; it is only a question of how and when.  Min was

      was picked up when growing up with her father, who was a miner.
      However, once she started to develop feelings for Rand, she began to
      wear more traditionally feminine attire.  Min was in Tar Valon helping

  <li><a class="name" id="Perrin">Perrin t&rsquo;Bashere Aybara</a>,
      p. 56 (58)&mdash;Young man from Emond&rsquo;s Field.  He is <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i>.
      When he and <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a> got separated from the rest of
      the group while fleeing the Trollocs on Winternight, Perrin met a man
      named Elyas Machera.  Elyas, a former Warder who
      found he could talk to wolves, helped Perrin discover the same ability in
      himself.  Perrin&rsquo;s eyes are now yellow, just like the wolves&rsquo; eyes, and
      he can enter what he calls the Wolf Dream (known to most as
      <i>Tel&rsquo;aran&rsquo;rhiod</i>, the World of Dreams) with them.  Perrin is a
      childhood friend of fellow <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i>
      <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a> and <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>.  On
      the way to Tear, Perrin encountered a young woman by the name of
      Zarine Bashere,
      a Hunter for the Horn who took the name of
      <a href="#Faile">Faile</a> (which means &ldquo;Falcon&rdquo; in the
      Old Tongue) as a more appropriate name for a Hunter for the Horn.  The
      two are now married.  Perrin is a very large man&mdash;he was
      always a big person, which caused him to be very cautious since he found
      as a child that he could easily hurt other children if his temper got
      out of hand.  His size helps considerably when helping
      <a href="#Luhhan">Master Luhhan</a> on his forge, but sometimes gives
      others the impression that he is slow and stupid.  He returned to the
      Two Rivers for a time to repel the series of Trolloc attacks; he and his
      wife are recognized as Lord and Lady there, the first noblility of the
      Two Rivers since the Trolloc Wars.  Perrin was instrumental in freeing
      Rand from his entrapment at Dumai&rsquo;s Wells; the two had a fight
      afterwards (they had planned it as a way for Perrin to leave, although
      they most likely did not plan on it being as violent as it was),
      and Perrin went to Ghealdan to see if he could tame

      <a href="#Bashere">Davram</a> and <a href="#Deira">Deira</a> Bashere, and
      their oldest surviving offspring.  Her two older brothers were killed,
      and when Davram sent her younger brother off to fight while keeping her
      at home, she ran away and swore the oath of a Hunter of the Horn in
      Illian.  When she became a Hunter, she renounced her old name,
      Zarine, at first considering adopting the name
      &ldquo;Mandarb&rdquo;&mdash;she chose Faile
      when she found <a href="#Mandarb">Mandarb</a> was the name of
      <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>&rsquo;s horse.  She fell in love with
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a> while on her search for the Horn, who
      told her that the Horn had been found.  She was shocked, but even more
      so to find out that <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> was the
      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> and that both he and Perrin are
      <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i>.  Faile stayed near Perrin, and finally accompanied him
      to the Two Rivers where she helped fend off the Trolloc attacks; the two
      were married shortly afterwards.  They were then proclaimed Lord and
      Lady of the Two Rivers.  Perrin hated the idea, but Faile insisted they
      have a modest estate, and even servants, which she trained herself.  Her
      name means &ldquo;Falcon&rdquo; in the Old Tongue; she is the falcon in
      <a href="#Min">Min</a>&rsquo;s viewings of Perrin.  She is very protective of
      her husband, and does whatever she can to make sure he not so much as
      <i>looks</i> at another woman, even though he has no intention of doing
      so.  She is a very jealous wife, especially toward people like
      <a href="#Berelain">Berelain</a> who eye her husband all the time.  She
      even cornered <a href="#Min">Min</a> when they first came to Caemlyn and
      Perrin greeted her warmly to make sure Min had no intentions toward
      him.

  <li><a class="name" id="Mat">Matrim (Mat)  Cauthon</a>,
      p. 62 (66)&mdash;A young man from Emond&rsquo;s Field.  He is <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i>.  Along
      with his good friends, <a href="#Rand">Rand al&rsquo;Thor</a> and
      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</a>, he left home to escape the Trolloc
      attacks after Winternight.  On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a
      dagger from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol,
      which he carried with him for a long time.  He was separated from the
      dagger by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his
      memory sequence.  These gaps were filled and more when he passed through
      the twisted door to the land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his
      three requests:  a foxhead medallion that protects him from women&rsquo;s
      channeling, a way out of the land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of
      past lifetimes that were the gaps in his memory.
      Mat&rsquo;s <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i> qualities manifest themselves particularly well
      with random events, such as dice games&mdash;he almost never loses a
      toss of the dice, even if the dice are weighted.
      He has found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling,
      and along with his newfound memories he can win almost every battle he
      fights quite decisively.  He has four sisters, including
      Eldrin and Bodewhin, who are 16 and 17, respectively.  His father
      <a href="#Abell">Abell</a> is one of the best archers in the Two Rivers,
      possibly in the World.  Mat has gotten in the habit of carrying
      concealed knives under his clothes in case he is attacked&mdash;his
      collection would surprise anyone.  In the Waste, he met a woman named
      Melindhra, a Maiden of the Spear from the Shaido Clan.
      However, she is not the <a href="#9Moons">Daughter of the Nine Moons</a>,
      who Mat is destined to marry according to the Aelfinn;
      besides, she tried to kill him on orders from her master among the
      Darkfriends.  Mat had to kill her to save his own skin, but regrets it
      deeply.  He has a scar along his neck from where the Eelfinn tried to
      kill him&mdash;which was also in accordance with what the Aelfinn told
      him, that he is &ldquo;to die and live again.&rdquo;  He currently heads
      an army called the Band of the Red Hand, after the army of
      King Aemon of
      old Manetheren, and serves in a way as Rand&rsquo;s personal
      general&mdash;this works well, since Mat seems to be a better general
      than even <a href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</a>, who has earned
      his good reputation as one of the best commanders alive.  Mat does not
      trust any Aes Sedai, and because of this refuses to take his foxhead
      medallion off even to take a bath.  Mat is currently in Ebou Dar trying
      to keep an eye on <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> and
      <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a> from getting themselves killed.

      Rand as a newborn on the slopes of Dragonmount and took him home with
      him since Rand&rsquo;s mother was dead.  He was at Dragonmount as part of the
      Aiel War, which he left home to participate in when he was young.  He
      became an officer in the Illianer army, and even achieved Blademaster
      status, acquiring a heron-mark sword.  He married a woman from Caemlyn,
      Kari, who he met while stationed there.  When the
      Aiel War started, he fought Aiel all the way to Tar Valon and the Battle
      of the Shining Walls, where he found Rand on the mountain.  Tam and Kari
      raised Rand as their own son.  Tam always won the archery competitions
      (or came in second to <a href="#Abell">Abell Cauthon</a>), and passed
      his archery skills on to Rand.  He also taught <a href="#Aram">Aram</a>

      died in the Two Rivers while scouting the

      <a href="#Perrin">Perrin</a>, and <a href="#Rand">Rand</a> should be

      &ldquo;I am not so lost to custom yet as to bond a man against his will.
      Not quite yet.&rdquo;  This appears to have changed, however, since one
      of the first things she did after seeing Rand was to bond him.  She
      later found that bonding Rand was a grievious error; not only is it
      impossible to compel him in comparison to most Warders (she compared it
      to attempting to uproot an oak tree with her bare hands), but she
      constantly feels the pain he experiences from the wound in his side,
      perhaps even more severely than he feels it.

      of the Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel.  Formerly a Maiden of the
      Spear, she was forced to give up the spear to become a Wise One because
      she had the ability to channel inborn.  She has green eyes, and is of

      that she was to fall in love with him when she went through the three
      rings in Rhuidean.  She denied her feelings for him at first, but when
      the wagons crossed the Dragonwall toward Cairhien, sweat tents became
      unavailable and she tried bathing as &ldquo;wetlanders&rdquo; did; Rand
      came in as she was standing before the bath in her skin, and she
      panicked.  She created a Traveling gateway to Seanchan (she does not

      middle of winter.  When Rand rescued her, she decided she could not hide
      her feelings any longer, and the two ended up spending the night in
      eachother&rsquo;s arms before coming back.  Aviendha says a similar incident
      will not occur, and punishes any Maiden who makes a crack about it (how
      they found out about something that occurred on the far side of the
      world on another continent is a different subject entirely).  She felt

  <li><a class="name" id="Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a>,
      p. 140 (167)&mdash;The <a href="#Dragon">Dragon</a>, Breaker of the World.  He
      was perhaps the greatest man who ever lived, and the most powerful Aes
      Sedai in recorded history.  During the War of the Shadow, he led the
      forces of the Light against the Forsaken, and led the final stroke which
      re-sealed the <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a> back into his prison.
      Unfortunately, during this stroke he was driven insane by the Dark One&rsquo;s
      touch, eventually killing his wife Ilyena, his
      children, and everyone he loved, as well as anyone who carried a drop of
      his blood.  For this act, people remember him with a new name:
      <a href="#Kinslayer">Kinslayer</a>.  After he had done this,
      <a href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</a> gave him his sanity back long enough for
      him to realize what he had done; Lews Therin killed himself by drawing on
      <i>saidin</i> too heavily, causing a mountain to form on the spot where
      he stood.  This mountain is called Dragonmount, and is near the
      present-day city of Tar Valon.  It is unfortunate that the name of one of
      the greatest men to ever live is now synonymous with evil, for Lews
      Therin killed his family due to the Dark One&rsquo;s influence, but without
      Lews Therin there may not have been a world left in which to kill them.
      Lews Therin&rsquo;s voice sometimes speaks inside <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>&rsquo;s
      head, offering advice or sobbing over lost women, but is getting more and
      more vocal.  It even tries to seize control of <i>saidin</i> sometimes,
      much to Rand&rsquo;s fear.

      uncrowned King of Malkier, who was fighting alone against the Shadow in
      the Blight; she asked Lan to become her Warder, and he accepted.  She is
      very strong in the Power, stronger than almost all living Aes Sedai.  In
      the Stone of Tear, Moiraine confronted and killed the Forsaken
      <a href="#Belal">Be&rsquo;lal</a> with balefire, just before he would have
      killed Rand.  Later, after having an inkling of the future events from
      the testing <i>ter&rsquo;angreal</i> for the Wise Ones, Moiraine managed to
      push the Forsaken <a href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</a> through the twisted
      doorway <i>ter&rsquo;angreal</i> into the land of the Eelfinn, trapping both
      her and Lanfear there.  It is unknown whether Moiraine lives on in the
      land off the Finn, or whether she is dead, but her bond with Lan has
      been severed, and other Aes Sedai consider her a legend, not only for
      discovering the <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a> but for killing or
      trapping two of the Forsaken as well.

      World beyond repair.  He went there to obtain the male statue, but was
      thwarted by Rand, who severed his bonds to the

      He then became Rand&rsquo;s teacher and went into hiding from the

      p. 431 (552)&mdash;Hero of Legend who conquered much of the known world
      about a thousand years ago.  He was perhaps the most strongly
      <i>ta&rsquo;veren</i> individual in recorded history besides
      <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a> and

      His armies put down those of <a href="#Guaire">Guaire Amalasan</a>,
      a false <a href="#Reborn">Dragon</a>.  He was given the
      name Hawkwing during this period, a designation based on his sigil.
      He later sent troops across the Aryth Ocean under his son,
      Luthair Paendrag Mondwhin, in hopes of conquering
      new lands there.  All contact with these armies ended with Hawkwing&rsquo;s
      death, which set off the War of the Hundred Years.  The descendants of
      the armies under Luthair have now returned to reclaim the lands of
      Hawkwing&rsquo;s empire in the Old World&mdash;they now call themselves the
      Seanchan.  His sign was a golden hawk in flight.

      <a href="#Elayne">Elayne</a> and <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</a>.  They
      had her keep a low profile for several days so as not to be hurt by the
      mob outside the Panarch&rsquo;s Palace (since it is not all that far from
      &ldquo;The Panarch is dead!&rdquo; to &ldquo;Death to the
      Panarch!&rdquo;), then she returned to her position.  When the Seanchan
      invaded Tanchico, she refused to willingly give her country to the new
      conquerors; they captured her, and forced her to live as a servant.
      She now serves as a dancer for <a href="#Suroth">High Lady Suroth</a>,
      the leader of the Seanchan pre-invasionary forces.

      was once punished for voicing her desire to have a Warder; later, as a

      suggested that Warders would make the job of a Red sister much easier.
      Seaine thinks she would have been happier as a Green.  When she was
      small, many members of her family were killed by Darkfriends; it is for

      the Shadow, less trusting, more cruel.  Slowly it became so, until
      finally the city was, if not darker than the Shadow, as dark.  The city
      finally turned on itself, consumed itself, tainting every grain of sand,
      every rock, every sip of water with its hatred.  Mordeth&rsquo;s soul remained
      in the city, now called Shadar Logoth (&ldquo;Where the Shadow
      Waits&rdquo;) for millenia&mdash;he could not leave the city unless he
      accompanied a person to the city walls or had them carry something from

      completely successful&mdash;instead, the two souls merged to create
      something more evil than either Mordeth or Fain alone.  Fain now feels

      <a href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</a>
      and narrowed it to three boys in Emond&rsquo;s Field.
      While persuing them, he encountered the spirit of
      Mordeth in Aridhol, now called Shadar Logoth.
      Mordeth attempted to consume Fain&rsquo;s soul, but instead the two souls
      merged, producing something more evil than either of them alone.  Fain
      no longer takes his orders from the Shadow; he has his own evil agenda.
      It is said, &ldquo;The look of the Eyeless is fear,&rdquo; from observing
      that a Myrddraal&rsquo;s look causes fear in the hearts of men.  Fain&rsquo;s look
      has that effect on Myrddraal&mdash;Fades feel the same fear of Fain as
      men feel from a Fade.  Fain is also called Ordeith, a
      name he adopted to become a Whitecloak officer.  He is perhaps the most
      evil man alive.  He now serves as advisor to
      <a href="#Toram">Toram Riatin</a>,
      one of the Cairhienin nobles in rebellion to
      <a href="#Rand">Rand</a>.  Rand has a bounty of 100,000 gold crowns on
      his head&mdash;Fain killed Rand&rsquo;s friends because they were his friends,
      he pillaged his homeland because it was his homeland, and Rand intends
      to see him dead for it.
