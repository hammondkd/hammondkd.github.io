<H2><A Name="A">A</A></H2>
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aan"><I>Aan'allein</I></A>, p.
      48&mdash;Aiel name for <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>.  It means &quot;One Man&quot;
      or &quot;Man Who is an Entire People&quot; in the Old Tongue.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Logain">Ablar, Logain</A>, p. 276&mdash;A false
      <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A> who created war in Ghealdan and surrounding
      nations before being captured and gentled by the Red Ajah.  He got loose
      during the chaos surrounding the deposing of
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>, and eventually was escorted out of
      Tar Valon by Siuan and her traveling companions.  Before he was gentled
      he was of considerable strength, and attracted quite a following of
      loyal soldiers.  <A Href="#Min">Min</A> still has viewings of him with a
      halo over his head, which she thinks indicates that he will become a
      figure of great power sometime in the future.  Recently, Logain has come
      forward with information that indicates the Red Ajah actually put him up
      to declaring himself the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>, most
      likely with the pretext that bringing down a false Dragon would bring
      more glory than gentling a simple man who could channel.  Logain was
      recently Healed by <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>, and was let free by
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> to do as he pleased; he went to join the
      rest of the Asha'man in the Black Tower.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon, The</A>;
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>;
      <A Href="#Rand">al'Thor, Rand</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Abram">Abram</A>, p. 346&mdash;Man
      after which the Feast of Abram is named.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Paitr">a'Conn, Paitr do Fearna</A>,
      p. 355&mdash;Murandian lord who met <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> and her
      army along with <A Href="#Pelivar">Pelivar</A> and
      <A Href="#Arathelle">Arathelle</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Adley">Adley, Jonan</A>, p.
      410&mdash;A soldier in the Black Tower.  He is from Altara despite his name,
      and is about four years older than <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aemin">Aemin</A>, p. 204&mdash;Graying, blocky
      farrier.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aeron">Aeron</A>, p. 30&mdash;Graying
      Wise One.  She cannot channel.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aginor">Aginor</A>, p. 266&mdash;One
      of the Forsaken.  During the Age of Legends, he was one of
      the foremost biologists of his time, specializing in genetics.  He went
      over to the Shadow because only there could he do all of the experiments
      he wanted to.  He was the one who created the Trollocs, Dragkhar,
      <I>gholam</I>, Darkhounds, and other Shadowspawn.  Some of the other
      Forsaken think he was insane, for only someone insane would create some
      of the creatures he did.  He was the second one to be released from
      the sealing on the Bore, after <A Href="#Balthamel">Balthamel</A>.
      He was trapped close to the surface of the Bore, so he was not shielded
      from the passing of time very effectively; he emerged as a very old man,
      so old that his face was wrinkled so that one could barely make out his
      features anymore.  He was killed by <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> at the Eye
      of the World.  Unbeknownst to almost everyone (including the Forsaken),
      Aginor has been reincarnated in the body of a Borderlander man.  He is
      now called <A Href="#Osangar">Osan'gar</A>.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Dashiva">Dashiva, Corlan</A>; <A Href="#Osangar">Osan'gar</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Ailron">Ailron</A>, p. 204&mdash;King
      of Amadicia until the Seanchan invaded.  He was not as strong as most
      kings due to the control of the Children of the Light&mdash;in fact, he has
      almost no real power at all.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Niall">Niall,
      Pedron</A>; <A Href="#Valda">Valda, Eamon</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Lelaine">Akashi, Lelaine</A>, p.
      70&mdash;Slender Sitter for the Blue Ajah in Salidar.  She carries a
      dignified air about her.  She was a Sitter in the White Tower for forty
      years until <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A> was deposed.  She is quite old.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alarys">Alarys</A>, p. 245&mdash;Wise
      One of the Shaido Aiel.  She has black hair, which is quite rare among
      the Aiel.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Lacile">Aldorwin, Lacile</A>, p. 185&mdash;Pale
      woman who wears a sword in slight imitation of the Aiel.  According to
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A>, she ahas challenging stare that makes the
      Two Rivers men think she might like a kiss despite her sword.  She is
      currently traveling with <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A>'s group.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aledrin">Aledrin</A>, p.
      382&mdash;Sitter for the White Ajah in the new Hall.  She has dark, golden
      hair and big, pale brown eyes.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Furen">Alharra, Furen</A>, p.
      161&mdash;One of <A Href="#Seonid">Seonid</A>'s Warders; from Tear.  He has
      graying, curly, black hair.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Seonid">Traighan,
      Seonid</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Zarya">Alkaese, Zarya</A>, p.
      542&mdash;Real name of <A Href="#Garenia">Garenia</A>, the name
      she used as a novice before <A Href="#Vandene">Vandene</A> and
      <A Href="#Adeleas">Adeleas</A> left on their retreat to Tifan's Well.
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Garenia">Rosoinde, Garenia</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Katerine">Alruddin, Katerine</A>,
      p. 27&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Red Ajah.  Though she keeps it secret, she is
      actually of the Black Ajah, and has been for twelve years.  She was
      captured by <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> during the battle at Dumai's Wells,
      but escaped her captors, most likely with assistance from Darkfriends.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alsalam">Alsalam</A>, p. 261&mdash;The
      King of Arad Doman.  He was not good enough for
      <A Href="#Graendal">Graendal</A>'s collection.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Rand">al'Thor, Rand</A>, p. 18&mdash;Young man from
      Emond's Field in the Two Rivers, now proclaimed to be the
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  He is very tall, with curly
      red-blond hair.  He was raised by <A Href="#Tam">Tam al'Thor</A> and his
      wife <A Href="#Kari">Kari</A> (until her death around the time Rand was
      five) in Emond's Field.  His real parents, however, were
      <A Href="#Janduin">Janduin</A>, the chief of the Taardad Aiel who
      brought the four clans across the Dragonwall to punish
      <A Href="#Laman">Laman</A>'s Sin, and a Maiden of the Spear named
      <A Href="#Shaiel">Shaiel</A>, who was actually
      <A Href="#Tigraine">Tigraine Damodred</A>, the runaway Daughter-Heir of
      Andor.  Tigraine gave birth to Rand on the slopes of Dragonmount, in
      accordance with prophecy; &quot;born of a Maiden, of the ancient blood
      but raised by the Old.&quot;  Rand has a heron branded into each of his
      palms, which he received from the sword Tam gave him while fighting
      <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A>.  He also has two dragons on his
      forearms, which he recieved in Rhuidean to designate him as the
      <I><A Href="#Caracarn">Car'a'carn</A></I>, the Chief of Chiefs of
      the Aiel.  He is not only the Dragon Reborn, but also <A Href="#Dawn">He
      Who Comes With the Dawn</A>, the man prophecied to reunite the Aiel, and
      the <A Href="#Coramoor">Coramoor</A>, the one prophecied to bring the
      Sea Folk out of the Sea.  He can channel strongly, more so than any
      person who ever lived (except the previous user of his soul,
      <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A>, who was obviously of equal
      strength), and is also <I>ta'veren</I>, the most strongly so since Lews
      Therin as well.  Lews Therin's voice has somehow found a new place
      inside of Rand's head; he talks to him in a mad voice when Rand least
      expects it, sometimes offering sound advice or knowledge, sometimes
      babbling, sometimes even trying to wrest control of <I>saidin</I> from
      him.  Unlike Lews Therin, Rand is accompanied by two other
      <I>ta'veren</I> during this turing of the Wheel, two men born within
      days (hours, even) of him named <A Href="#Mat">Matrim Cauthon</A> and
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A>, who both grew up in Emond's Field
      as well.  Rand is destined to fall in love with three women (and has):
      <A Href="#Min">Min Farshaw</A>, <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</A>,
      and <A Href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</A>.  Rand has had success in fighting
      many of the Forsaken; all to confront him have died or been trapped.  He
      killed <A Href="#Aginor">Aginor</A> at the Eye of the World after the
      <A Href="../book1/alphalast.html#Green">Green Man</A> killed
      <A Href="../book6/alphalast.html#Balthamel">Balthamel</A>; he allowed
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> to kill <A Href="#Belal">Be'lal</A> in
      the Stone of Tear, and killed <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A> in the
      Stone shortly afterward; in the wagons near the Spine of the World,
      <A Href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</A> confronted him and was pushed into the
      land of the Eelfinn by Moiraine; he killed <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A>
      in <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I> when he came to the Royal Palace in Caemlyn;
      and <A Href="#Asmodean">Asmodean</A>, his teacher, was killed shortly
      after Rahvin met his fate.  His prophecies fulfilled grow:  he has
      already been born on the slopes of Dragonmount of a Maiden, of the
      ancient blood but raised by the old, taken the Stone of Tear and drawn
      <I>Callandor</I>, and began conquering &quot;under the forgotten
      symbol,&quot; that of the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  He is
      working on having the &quot;spotless tower&quot; break and bend knee to
      him (several Aes Sedai have sworn fealty to him and only him).  He is
      the salvation of the entire world, and as the prophecy states, he
      <I>will</I> save the world&mdash;and Break it again.  <I>See also</I>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Tam">al'Thor, Tamlin (Tam)</A>, p.
      284&mdash;<A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s father.  He taught Rand about the Flame
      and the Void, a trick he uses to concentrate and to win archery
      competitions; Rand found that it is the way he can gain access to
      <I>saidin</I>.  Tam is not actually Rand's biological father; he found
      Rand as a newborn on the slopes of Dragonmount and took him home with
      him since Rand's mother was dead.  He was at Dragonmount as part of the
      Aiel War, which he left home to participate in when he was young.  He
      became an officer in the Illianer army, and even achieved Blademaster
      status, acquiring a heron-mark sword.  In fact,
      <A Href="#Marcolin">Demetre Marcolin</A> served under him when he was a
      Second Captain in the Companions.  He married a woman from Caemlyn,
      <A Href="#Kari">Kari</A>, who he met while stationed there.  When the
      Aiel War started, he fought Aiel all the way to Tar Valon and the Battle
      of the Shining Walls, where he found Rand on the mountain.  Tam and Kari
      raised Rand as their own son.  Tam always won the archery competitions
      (or came in second to <A Href="#Abell">Abell Cauthon</A>), and passed
      his archery skills on to Rand.  He also taught <A Href="#Aram">Aram</A>
      how to use his sword.  It is not known if Tam knew that the child
      he was raising was the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  <I>See

      Rand</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Egwene">al'Vere, Egwene</A>, p.
      60&mdash;A young woman from Emond's Field, now raised to the
      <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A> among the Aes Sedai opposing
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>.  She has considerable strength with the
      One Power, and will most likely be one of the strongest Aes Sedai in
      over a thousand years.  She is also the first Dreamer in the Tower in
      almost 500 years; she trained with the Wise Ones to learn more of this
      Talent.  Egwene is good friends with
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</A>, the Daughter-Heir of Andor, and is
      also a childhood friend of <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, the Dragon
      Reborn.  In fact, Rand and Egwene were all but Promised in their youth,
      but both of them feels an almost sibling-like love for each other now;
      they know that they cannot get married, and do not want to.  Egwene is
      the love object of both of Elayne's brothers, <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A>
      and <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>&mdash;she is flattered by Galad's attentions,
      but she does not return them; she does find Gawyn to her liking, and had
      a dream of bonding him as her Warder; she knows it will occur.  Egwene
      was most likely chosen Amyrlin because the Aes Sedai thought she could
      be guided by them without too much trouble; if this was their intent,
      they made a grave mistake, for Egwene shows promise to be one of the
      strongest Amyrlins in history.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Marin">al'Vere, Marin</A>;
      <A Href="#Gawyn">Trakand, Gawyn</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Doesine">Alwain, Doesine</A>, p.
      509&mdash;Boyishly slim Aes Sedai of the Yellow Ajah.  She is tall for a
      Cairhienin.  Her father was a cutler.  She ran away three times as a
      novice, although she only got as far as the gates once.  She has a bit
      of a foul tongue.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alwhin">Alwhin</A>, p. 458&mdash;Voice
      of the Blood, in service of <A Href="#Suroth">High Lady Suroth</A>.  She
      is a glowering woman.  Originally a <I>sul'dam</I>, she was intended to
      be the Leash Holder for <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> when she and
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> were given to Suroth by
      <A Href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</A>.  She was later promoted to a Voice of
      the Blood, the first <I>sul'dam</I> to ascend to the Blood.  However, it
      was thought unwise to leave her as a simple <I>sul'dam</I>; she knew too
      much.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Merana">Ambrey, Merana</A>, p.
      271&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Gray Ajah with hazel eyes.  She is now an
      apprentice of the Wise Ones.  The events following Dumai's Wells shook
      her so deeply that <A Href="#Cadsuane">Cadsuane</A> thinks she will
      never quite recover herself.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>, p. 34&mdash;The leader of
      the Aes Sedai, their equivalent of a King or Queen.  She in theory holds
      supreme power amongst the sisters, and leads the Hall of the Tower at
      its meetings.  Kings and queens of nations strong and weak will come if
      summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their entire trip figuring
      out how they will put a knife in her back while there.  The Seat is
      traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in her
      character.  The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must the
      vote to depose one.  Once chosen the Amyrlin is said to be &quot;of all
      Ajahs and none&quot;&mdash;all previous affiliations with Ajah are ignored
      (at least in theory).  The Ajahs have gotten fairly equal numbers of
      Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions:  no Amyrlin has
      been raised from the Red Ajah since
      <A Href="../book5/alphalast.html#Bonwhin">Bonwhin Meraighdin</A>, who
      was deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in
      <A Href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</A>'s day, except for
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</A>, the current Amyrlin
      Seat in Tar Valon; the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of
      Amyrlins from its Ajah&mdash;four of the last the last five Amyrlins (before
      Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah.  These two exceptions to the
      mean number of Amyrlins from one's Ajah have only added to the friction
      between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years.  The Amyrlin has a
      secretary of sorts, the <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A>,
      who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the Amyrlin was
      raised from.  The office was held by <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>,
      raised from the Blue Ajah, until she was deposed for her involvement
      with events surrounding the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  Her
      successor was the leader of the coup, <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny
      a'Roihan</A>, raised from the Red Ajah.  Siuan's deposition divided the
      Tower, and the faction opposing Elaida raised a new Amyrlin who could
      not be accused of choosing sides on the day Siuan was deposed:
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A>, who was outside the Tower and not
      even a full sister from the time Siuan was deposed to the time she was
      Raised.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Anghara">Anghara</A>;

      One of the Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel.
      <A Href="#Rhuarc">Rhuarc</A>'s wife (one of two).  She is one of the
      Wise Ones that trained <A Href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</A> and
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>.  She can channel.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Anaiya">Anaiya</A>, p. 329&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Blue Ajah.  She has blunt, motherly facial
      features.  She was very good friends with
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> both as a novice and as a full sister.
      She, like all Blues, fled the Tower when <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>
      was raised to the Striped Stole, and now carries a position of
      considerable influence in the &quot;Little Tower&quot; in Salidar.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Roedran">a'Naloy, Roedran Almaric do Arreloa</A>,
      p. 366&mdash;King of Murandy, at least in name.  In
      reality, Murandians hold allegiance to lords only, and those lords often
      refuse to pay their taxes to the King.  He hopes to make himself the
      first <I>true</I> king of Murandy in its history.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Torean">Andiama, Torean</A>, p.
      418&mdash;Potato-nosed High Lord of Tear.  He looks more like a farmer than
      most farmers, despite being the richest man in Tear.  He was charged
      with financing the Cairhienin campaign.  His son
      <A Href="#Estean">Estean</A> was also involved in the battle.

      in a form of dueling popular right after the creation of the Bore.  The

      died from the slow poison on the daggers.  The other Forsaken consider

      has no place on his list of dead women, she has claimed one
      nonetheless.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Elaida">a'Roihan, Elaida do Avriny</A>, p.
      23&mdash;Aes Sedai formerly of the Red Ajah, now raised to the
      <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>.  She was born the youngest daughter
      of a minor House in the north of Murandy.  She served as advisor to
      <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A> of Andor for her entire reign, and
      led the coup that deposed <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> and placed
      her on the Amyrlin Seat in Siuan's place.  She distrusts anyone not of
      her Ajah (as most Reds do), and does not believe she will ever trust any
      member of the Blue Ajah again, even in the slightest.  Her
      <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A> is
      <A Href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</A> of the White Ajah&mdash;she was all
      but forced to choose Alviarin due to her role in the deposition of
      Siuan.  If she chose a Keeper from her Ajah, she most likely would not
      have won the support of the White Ajah, and then <I>she</I> would have
      been stilled and banished from the Tower instead of Siuan.  She
      sometimes has the Foretelling, but not all that often or that strongly.
      One of her Foretellings was that the Royal Family of Andor would play a
      crucial role in the Last Battle&mdash;this Foretelling occurred around the
      time the Succession was going on, so she immediately attached herself to
      Morgase as soon as it became clear that she would be the one to take the
      Lion Throne.  Another was to predict that
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> would shake the world on its very
      foundations&mdash;she constantly kicks herself for not doing something about
      him when he was in front of her, little more than a farmboy at the time.
      Her most recent Foretelling was that "the White Tower would be whole
      again, except for remnants cast out and scorned, whole and stronger than
      ever.  <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> will face the Amyrlin Seat and
      know her anger.  The Black Tower will be rent in blood and fire, and
      sisters will walk its grounds."  The Foretelling about Rand is obviously
      deadly accurate.  However, the one about the Royal Family occurred at an
      inopportune time; at the time of Elaida's Foretelling, the Royal Family
      wasn't certain.  It may have meant Morgase, <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>,
      <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A>, and <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> (they have
      all had a large role to play in the recent past), but it is also
      possible it could have meant the old Royal Family, that of
      <A Href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</A>, <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail</A>,
      Galad, and later Elayne and Gawyn as well.  After all, Morgase is just
      Morgase, but Tigraine is the mother of the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon
      Reborn</A>.  Her most recent Foretelling will of course be fulfilled,
      but not necessarily how she wants it to be; she doesn't realize that the
      Amyrlin Seat in the Foretelling might not be her, that the remnants cast
      out might be those loyal to her, and that the destruction of the Black
      Tower might have nothing to do with her.  Elaida is quite strong in the
      One Power; only Siuan, <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>,
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>, <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>,
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>, and a few others can match her strength.
      Elaida has always sought positions of power; she chose to follow Morgase
      to have a better chance at guiding the forces in the Last Battle, and
      tried to capture Rand al'Thor in an effort to gain similar control.  The
      only sisters that support her are those that are actually Black Ajah and
      those that would follow any Amyrlin legally raised, as Elaida was
      (although just barely; all laws used to raise her were stretched almost
      to their breaking point, and some believe they actually did shatter).
      Elaida is currently building a palace for herself atop the Warders' old
      practice yard.  The building will be about as tall as the White Tower.

      485&mdash;One of the Forsaken.  He was born Joar Addam
      Nessosin in the then coastal city of Shorelle, a child prodigy in
      music and art.  He gave his life to the Shadow in exchange for the
      immortality he received, so he could study and perfect his music.  After
      being released from the Bore, he was coerced by
      <A Href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</A> into coming with her, eventually to teach
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> to channel without killing himself.  Asmodean
      was drawn to Rhuidean and the stash of <I>angreal</I>,
      <I>ter'angreal</I>, and most especially the two white statue
      <I>ter'angreal</I> that linked the holder to the great <I>sa'angreal</I>
      buried near Cairhien and on Tremalking, which together could Break the
      World beyond repair.  He went there to obtain the male statue, but was
      thwarted by Rand, who severed his bonds to the <A Href="#Dark">Dark
      One</A>.  He then became Rand's teacher, and went into hiding from the
      rest of the Chosen, who would kill him on sight if they saw him.  He was

      <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A> and Lanfear were killed/trapped.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Saerin">Asnobar, Saerin</A>, p. 500&mdash;Sitter for

      dark temples which emphasize a thin, age-faded white scar.  Only a
      Warder could match her for scowling.  She has held her chair in the Hall
      for forty years.  Everyone knows to be wary of her temper.  She was born
      the daughter of an innkeeper, and was first trained by the Daughters of
      Silence (an organization similar to, but shorter-lived and smaller than
      the Kin)&mdash;she was the only one of them to ever obtain the shawl.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aviendha">Aviendha</A>, p. 46&mdash;Aiel of the Nine
      Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel.  Formerly a Maiden of the Spear, she
      was forced to give up the spear to become a Wise One because she had the
      ability to channel inborn.  She has green eyes, and is of age with
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> and <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>.  She is more than
      pretty with dark, reddish hair.  Aviendha is one of the three women in
      <A Href="#Min">Min</A>'s viewing of Rand&mdash;she also saw that she was to
      fall in love with him when she went through the three rings in Rhuidean.
      She denied her feelings for him at first, but when the wagons crossed
      the Dragonwall toward Cairhien, sweat tents became unavailable and she
      tried bathing as &quot;wetlanders&quot; did; Rand came in as she was
      standing before the bath in her skin, and she panicked.  She created a
      Traveling gateway to Seanchan (she does not remember how), trying to get
      as far away from Rand as possible, into the middle of winter.  When Rand
      rescued her, she decided she could not hide her feelings any longer, and
      the two ended up spending the night in each other's arms before coming
      back.  Aviendha says a similar incident will not occur, and punishes any
      Maiden who makes a crack about it (how they found out about something
      that occurred on the far side of the world on another continent is a
      different subject entirely).  She felt <I>toh</I> toward
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> for violating her trust, but upon hearing
      that Elayne would consent to being her sister-wife, Aviendha felt
      empowered to show her feelings for Rand once again.  She is not certain
      what she thinks of a <I>second</I> sister-wife in Min, but she is
      determined to meet her before passing any judgement.  She is currently

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Faile">t'Aybara, Faile ni Bashere</A>, p.

      the daughter of <A Href="#Bashere">Davram</A> and
      <A Href="#Deira">Deira</A> Bashere, and their oldest surviving
      offspring.  Her two older brothers were killed, and when Davram sent her
      younger brother off to fight while keeping her at home, she ran away and
      swore the oath of a Hunter of the Horn in Illian.  When she became a
      Hunter, she renounced her old name, Zarine, at first considering
      adopting the name &quot;Mandarb&quot;&mdash;she chose Faile when she found
      <A Href="#Mandarb">Mandarb</A> was the name of <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>'s
      horse.  She fell in love with <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A> while
      on her search for the Horn, who told her that the Horn had been found.
      She was shocked, but even more so to find out that
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> was the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> and
      that both he and Perrin are <I>ta'veren</I>.  Faile stayed near Perrin,
      and finally accompanied him to the Two Rivers where she helped fend off
      the Trolloc attacks; the two were married shortly afterwards.  They were
      then proclaimed Lord and Lady of the Two Rivers.  Perrin hated the idea,
      but Faile insisted they have a modest estate, and even servants, which
      she trained herself.  Her name means &quot;falcon&quot; in the Old
      Tongue; she is the falcon in <A Href="#Min">Min</A>'s viewings of
      Perrin.  She is very protective of her husband, and does whatever she
      can to make sure he not so much as <I>looks</I> at another woman, even
      though he has no intention of doing so.  She is a very jealous wife,
      especially toward people like <A Href="#Berelain">Berelain</A> who eye
      her husband all the time.  She even cornered <A Href="#Min">Min</A> when
      they first came to Caemlyn and Perrin greeted her warmly to make sure
      Min had no intentions toward him.  <I>See also</I>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Perrin">Aybara, Perrin t'Bashere</A>, p.
      157&mdash;Young man from Emond's Field.  He is <I>ta'veren</I>.  When he and
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> got separated from the rest of the group
      while fleeing the Trollocs on Winternight, Perrin met a man named
      <A Href="#Elyas">Elyas Machera</A>.  Elyas, a former Warder who found he
      could talk to wolves, helped Perrin discover the same ability in
      himself.  Perrin's eyes are now yellow, just like the wolves' eyes, and
      he can enter what he calls the Wolf Dream (known to most as
      <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>, the World of Dreams) with them.  Perrin is a
      childhood friend of fellow <I>ta'veren</I>
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> and <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A>.  On
      the way to Tear, Perrin encountered a young woman by the name of
      <A Href="#Zarine">Zarine Bashere</A>, a Hunter for the Horn who took the
      name of <A Href="#Faile">Faile</A> (which means &quot;Falcon&quot; in
      the Old Tongue) as a more appropriate name for a Hunter for the Horn.
      The two are now married.  Perrin is a very large man&mdash;he was always a
      big person, which caused him to be very cautious since he found as a
      child that he could easily hurt other children if his temper got out of
      hand.  His size helps considerably when helping
      <A Href="#Haral">Master Luhhan</A> on his forge, but sometimes gives
      others the impression that he is slow and stupid.  He returned to the
      Two Rivers for a time to repel the series of Trolloc attacks; he and his
      wife are recognized as Lord and Lady there, the first noblility of the
      Two Rivers since the Trolloc Wars.  Perrin was instrumental in freeing
      Rand from his entrapment at Dumai's Wells; the two had a fight
      afterwards (they had planned it as a way for Perrin to leave, although
      they most likely did not plan on it being as violent as it was), and
      Perrin went to Ghealdan to see if he could tame

      fled to Salidar with the rest of her Ajah.  She led the group of six
      sisters that hold most of the influence in Salidar, despite not being
      part of the Hall of the Tower.  Her tilted, green eyes can be used to
      intimidate novices and Aes Sedai alike.  She is now the

      Sedai of the Green Ajah with an elliptical face.  She is young (she has

      She treats all of them as husbands in defiance of all law and custom,
      inside the Tower and out.  She fled the White Tower when
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A> was deposed, along with most of her Ajah.
      She is one of the six sisters who hold much of the power in Salidar
      despite not being part of the Hall of the Tower.  She received
      <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>'s bond after <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>'s
      death, bringing her Warder count to four, at least until
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> is ready to have him as a Warder.  She
      seems to be the resident expert on saving Warders; three of her four

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Bryne">Bryne, Gareth</A>, p.
      140&mdash;Former First Prince of the Sword and Captain of the Queen's Guards
      under <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A> in Andor.  He was appointed
      to the position because Morgase had no living male relatives, but was
      exiled from Caemlyn on a suggestion from Morgase's new advisor,
      <A Href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</A>.  He moved to his private estates
      in rural Andor, where he presided over the trial of three young women
      who unintentionally burned a barn: they turned out to be
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>, the former <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin
      Seat</A>; <A Href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</A>, the former
      <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A>, and
      <A Href="#Min">Min Farshaw</A>.  When these three made an oath to serve
      him and then apparently broke it, he followed them out of sheer
      curiosity to Salidar.  Once their, he discovered the true identity of
      the three, as well as that the Tower was truly broken.  The Aes Sedai in
      Salidar persuaded him to command the army they would need to take the
      Amyrlin Seat from <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>, since he was the only
      commander that the Warders thought would be willing and able to help
      them.  He is one of the six best military commanders west of the Aiel
      Waste, in a league with <A Href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</A>,
      <A Href="#Rodel">Rodel Ituralde</A>, <A Href="#Bashere">Davram
      Bashere</A>, <A Href="#Agelmar">Agelmar Jagad</A>, and
      <A Href="#Mat">Matrim Cauthon</A>.  Although neither of them would admit
      it, Bryne seems to be developing feelings for Siuan Sanche; he wishes to
      avoid another mistake like his relationship as
      <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A>'s lover, and also never forgave Siuan for
      when she publicly shamed him years ago.  She seems to be developing
      similar feelings for him, much to her dismay.  He plans to be the first
      ever general to take the city of Tar Valon; the closest anyone else ever
      came was with <A Href="#Guaire">Guaire Amalasan</A>'s armies, who got as
      far as the White Tower itself, and <A Href="#Hawkwing">Artur
      Hawkwing</A>, who never managed to go beyond beseiging the city.
      Actually, Amalasan's troops never beseiged the city, they simply managed
      to breech the walls; Hawkwing never managed to stop the supply ships
      coming up the river.  Bryne believes he will be able to overcome this
      problem.

      Lord Captain Commander.  Surprisingly enough for a Whitecloak, much less
      a Questioner, Carridin is a Darkfriend.  He was given orders (under the
      name <A Href="#Bors">Bors</A>) by <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A> to
      find and kill <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, and those orders were
      strengthened by a Myrddraal who promised to kill another member of
      Carridin's family every month until al'Thor was dead.  So far, Carridin
      has lost a cousin (found skinned alive in his bed) and his youngest
      sister <A Href="#Dealda">Dealda</A> (carried from her bridal feast by a
      Fade).  His older sister, <A Href="#Vanora">Vanora</A>, recently met

      for all but five of her almost ninety years wearing the shawl; she is of
      high standing among the Black sisters.  She is now the head of the Red
      Ajah, and led the expedition to bring <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> to Tar
      Valon after he was shielded.  She was captured by the Shaido after the
      battle at Dumai's Wells, and is now a prisoner of
      <A Href="#Sevanna">Sevanna</A>.  Galina has long black hair without a
      touch of gray in it.  She claims to have helped break two
      <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin</A>'s as a Black sister&mdash;one
      (<A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>) was deposed and
      stilled, and the other was made to appear that she'd died in her sleep.
      She led the circle that stilled Siuan.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Romanda">Cassin, Romanda</A>, p.
      70&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Yellow Ajah with solid gray hair and a high
      soprano voice.  She is the eldest of the Sitters in the Hall of the
      Little Tower.  She came out of her retirement when news of
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A> and <A Href="#Leane">Leane</A> came to her.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Mat">Cauthon, Matrim (Mat)</A>, p. 48&mdash;Young man
      from Emond's Field.  He is <I>ta'veren</I>.  Along with his good
      friends, <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> and
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A>, he left home to escape the Trolloc
      attacks after Winternight.  On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a
      dagger from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol,
      which he carried with him for a long time.  He was separated from the
      dagger by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his
      memory sequence.  These gaps were filled and more when he passed through
      the twisted door to the land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his
      three requests:  a foxhead medallion that protects him from women's
      channeling, a way out of the land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of
      past lifetimes that were the gaps in his memory.  Mat's <I>ta'veren</I>
      qualities manifest themselves particularly well with random events, such
      as dice games&mdash;he almost never loses a toss of the dice, even if the
      dice are weighted.  He has found that battles are the ultimate form of
      gambling, and along with his newfound memories he can win almost every
      battle he fights quite decisively.  He has four sisters, including
      <A Href="#Eldrin">Eldrin</A> and <A Href="#Bode">Bodewhin</A>, who are
      17 and 16, respectively.  His father <A Href="#Abell">Abell</A> is one
      of the best archers in the Two Rivers, possibly in the World.  Mat has
      gotten in the habit of carrying concealed knives under his clothes in
      case he is attacked&mdash;his collection would surprise anyone.  In the
      Waste, he met a woman named Melindhra, a Maiden of the Spear from the
      Shaido Clan.  However, she is not the
      <A Href="#9Moons">Daughter of the Nine Moons</A>, who Mat is destined to
      marry according to the Aelfinn; besides, she tried to kill him on orders
      from her master among the Darkfriends.  Mat had to kill her to save his
      own skin, but regrets it deeply.  He also has a scar along his neck from
      where the Eelfinn tried to kill him&mdash;which was also in accordance with
      what the Aelfinn told him, that he is &quot;to die and live again.&quot;
      He currently leads an army called the Band of the Red Hand, after the
      army of <A Href="#Aemon">King Aemon</A> of old Manetheren, and serves in
      a way as Rand's personal general&mdash;this works well, since Mat seems to be
      a better general than even <A Href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</A>, who
      has earned his reputation as one of the best commanders alive.  Mat does
      not trust any Aes Sedai, and because of this refuses to take his foxhead
      medallion off even to take a bath.  Mat is currently in Ebou Dar trying
      to keep an eye on <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> and
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> and prevent them from getting themselves

      a throne unlike anything the world had ever seen precipitated the Aiel
      War.  The war continued for years until all nations united against the

      Aiel killed Laman and took his sword.  Because of Laman's Pride, and his

      city never again reached any of its former glory&mdash;but it also allowed

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Moiraine">Damodred, Moiraine</A>, p. 276&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Blue Ajah.  Born of a noble House in Cairhien, she is
      <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</A>'s youngest half-sister,
      and <A Href="#Laman">King Laman</A>'s niece.  She is considered short
      among her people, and the Cairhienin are already a short people.  When
      it was discovered that she had the ability to channel inborn, Moiraine
      went to Tar Valon to become an Aes Sedai.  Just before being raised to
      the shawl, she and her friend <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>
      witnessed Gitara Moroso's Foretelling of the Rebirth of the
      <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>.  Moiraine and Siuan walked away from each
      other and did not speak to each other again (at least in public), but
      both held secret communication with each other and dedicated their lives
      to finding and guiding the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.
      Moiraine found the young man she sought on Winternight in Emond's Field,
      a young man named <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, along with two more
      <I>ta'veren</I>, <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A> and
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A> and two women with the spark of the
      Power inborn, <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A> and
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</A>.  When Moiraine was shortly
      raised to the shawl, she met <A Href="#Lan">al'Lan Mandragoran</A>, the
      uncrowned King of Malkier, who was fighting alone against the Shadow in
      the Blight; she asked Lan to become her Warder, and he accepted.  She is
      very strong in the Power, stronger than almost all living Aes Sedai.  In
      the Stone of Tear, Moiraine confronted and killed the Forsaken
      <A Href="#Belal">Be'lal</A> with balefire, just before he would have
      killed Rand.  Later, after having an inkling of the future events from
      the testing <I>ter'angreal</I> for the Wise Ones, Moiraine managed to
      push the Forsaken <A Href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</A> through the twisted
      doorway <I>ter'angreal</I> into the land of the Eelfinn, trapping both
      her and Lanfear there.  It is unknown whether Moiraine lives on in the
      land off the Finn, or whether she is dead, but her bond with Lan has
      been severed, and other Aes Sedai consider her a legend, not only for
      discovering the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> but for killing or
      trapping two of the Forsaken as well.  Despite her efforts, and for the
      most part, success, <A Href="#Cadsuane">Cadsuane</A> still thinks she

      the first day proceeded to almost equal Lews Therin's accomplishments,
      almost equal Lews Therin's strength, and almost equal him but never
      surpass him in everything.  He became one of the Light's greatest
      generals, once again second in command under Lews Therin.  Demandred
      believed that he was Lews Therin's intellectual and military superior,
      and was furious when Lews Therin was chosen to lead the Light's forces
      over him during the War of the Shadow.  He developed a burning hatred of
      Lews Therin, and finally dedicated his life to the Shadow so he could
      finally better Lews Therin&mdash;he believed the Shadow would eventually win
      the war since Lews Therin was commanding the Light's armies, and that if
      he, Barid Bel Medar, had been chosen to command them, the Light would
      have prevailed.  When Demandred was freed from the Bore, he transferred
      his hatred of Lews Therin intact to the new recipient of his soul,
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>.  Demandred was recently told by the

      Trakand.  She has many wise sayings, which Elayne and Morgase are fond
      of quoting to themselves and others (probably because they have been
      ingrained into their minds so much).  She went with Morgase when she
      fled Andor to Amadicia.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Fain">Fain, Padan</A>, p. 523&mdash;Former peddler
      that frequently came to Emond's Field.  A Darkfriend, he was given
      orders to locate the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> and narrowed it
      to three boys in Emond's Field.  While persuing them, he encountered the
      spirit of <A Href="#Mordeth">Mordeth</A> in Aridhol, now called Shadar
      Logoth.  Mordeth attempted to consume Fain's soul, but instead the two
      souls merged, producing something more evil than either of them alone.
      Fain no longer takes his orders from the Shadow; he has his own evil
      agenda.  It is said, &quot;The look of the Eyeless is fear,&quot; from
      observing that a Myrddraal's look causes fear in the hearts of men.
      Fain's look has that effect on Myrddraal&mdash;Fades feel the same fear of
      Fain as men feel from a Fade.  Fain is also called
      <A Href="#Ordeith">Ordeith</A>, a name he adopted to become a Whitecloak
      officer.  He is perhaps the most evil man alive.  He now serves as
      advisor to <A Href="#Toram">Toram Riatin</A>, one of the Cairhienin
      nobles in rebellion to <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>.  Rand has a bounty of
      100,000 gold crowns on his head&mdash;Fain killed Rand's friends because they
      were his friends, he pillaged his homeland because it was his homeland,
      and Rand intends to see him dead for it.  <I>See also</I>

      <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin</A>.  She sits with

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Min">Farshaw, Elmindreda (Min)</A>,
      p. 153&mdash;A young woman from Baerlon.  She has a special ability that
      few besides herself know about:  she sees images and auras around
      people, especially around Aes Sedai and Warders, that foretell their
      futures.  Min does not always know what these viewings mean, but when
      she does, it <I>will</I> happen; it is only a question of how and when.
      Min was fascinated by the number of images she saw around
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>, especially the one she saw that included
      herself:  he is destined to fall in love with three different women, one
      of which is herself.  She usually dresses in attire reserved for men;
      this habit was picked up when growing up with her father, who was a
      miner.  However, once she started to develop feelings for Rand, she
      began to wear more traditionally feminine attire.  Min was in Tar Valon
      helping <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A> with her viewings' information when
      Siuan was deposed, and it was Min that freed Siuan and
      <A Href="#Leane">Leane</A> from the dungeon.  She accompanied the two
      former leaders of the Aes Sedai to Salidar; once there, she left for
      Caemlyn with Salidar's embassy to Rand.  Once in Caemlyn, she brought
      information to Rand about the embassy there, and their intentions.  She
      has only had one viewing that ever failed, which concerned
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>; since Moiraine is believed dead, she
      hopes that her viewings might be wrong at least once in a while.  Min is
      one of only two women that can rightfully call herself a lover to the
      <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon Reborn</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Irgain">Fatamed, Irgain</A>, p. 28&mdash;Aes Sedai of
      the Green Ajah.  She was stilled by <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> during the

      torn limb from limb by a <I>gholam</I>, or possibly
      <A Href="#Slayer">Slayer</A>, for unknown reasons, although it
      is likely that he'd stumbled upon something quite damaging to the cause
      of the Shadow if they'd send a <I>gholam</I> or Slayer to do the job.
      <A Href="#Min">Min</A> is currently reading his book, <I>Reason and

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Flinn">Flinn, Damer</A>, p. 294&mdash;Crease-faced old
      man with a limp, now one of the Asha'man.  He is bald with a fringe of
      white hair around the edge of his head.  He was in the Queen's Guards
      until he took a Murandian lance in the thigh, and ever since has desired
      to help people with injuries.  He came for the amnesty to see if he
      could learn to Heal; as it turns out, he is very Talented, and has
      developed methods of Healing that have been forgotten since the
      Age of Legends.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Andaya">Forae, Andaya</A>, p.
      490&mdash;Sitter for the Gray Ajah in Tar Valon.  She has light brown hair,
      and grew up in Tarabon.  She reminds <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A> of a
      sparrow about to hop to another branch.  She is neither small nor slim.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Careane">Fransi, Careane</A>, p.
      64&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah.  She has shoulders and arms as big as
      most men.  She grew up in Arad Doman.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alviarin">Freidhen, Alviarin</A>, p. 492&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the White Ajah, but secretly the head of the Black Ajah.  She
      was chosen to head the Black Ajah after the previous leader was killed
      by <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A> after she managed to kill off the
      <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A> without Ishamael's approval.
      Typical of most Whites, she has a very cool, collected personality.  She
      serves as <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A> under
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>, despite being of a different Ajah than
      Elaida was raised from.  Elaida was all but forced to choose Alviarin in
      order to gain the support of the White Ajah when bringing charges
      against <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A>; unknown to Elaida, this also brought
      her the support of the Black Ajah.  Without Alviarin as Keeper, the
      White Ajah would most likely have been divided over whether to depose
      Siuan, and only the Red would be behind Elaida, which would most likely
      have led to the stilling of Elaida and possibly even the dismantling of
      the Red Ajah.  It still may, since Elaida is rapidly losing her power to
      Alviarin&mdash;and if Alviarin's loyalties are ever revealed, nothing will
      save either of them.  Alviarin has been shown how to Travel by

      coppery skin and long, glossy dark hair and dark eyes.  She was given
      twenty years penance, and spent fifteen years away from the
      Tower until <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A> summoned her back to active
      service.  She was formerly a Sitter for the Red.  Elaida named her to
      lead the team of fifty sisters that she sent to Caemlyn to attempt to
      capture any men who can channel that they find; unfortunately, she
      vastly underestimated their numbers, and the entire team will most
      likely be killed or captured in minutes once the Asha'man realize what
      they intend to do.  It is too late to call her back, however.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Graendal">Graendal</A>, p.
      260&mdash;One of the Forsaken.  A fleshy woman with curled red-gold hair.
      Before the War of the Shadow, she became the leading authority on
      diseases of the brain, and spent much of her life dealing with the
      insane, schizophrenic, and others well beyond the touch of Healing.  She
      was the best at subtle manipulations of the human mind that ever lived.
      After the Bore was drilled, she went through a change as she realized
      the world could never live up to her standards.  So she began dressing
      in the very way she once mocked, with low cut dresses that clung to her
      and left little to the imagination.  After being released from the Bore,
      Graendal took up residence in Arad Doman, capturing several members of
      the Royal Family to use as servants.  All of her servants are not only
      physically well shaped and good-looking, but also had power in their
      society before she captured them.  She includes in her collection the
      sister of the Domani king, two rulers from Shara, and other important
      figures.  She worked with <A Href="#Sammael">Sammael</A> in the
      recent past, but since his disappearance has been working more closely

      Doom to converse with the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>.  He is head and
      shoulders taller than all other Myrddraal, who are the height of an
      average man and all the same height.  His name means &quot;Hand of the
      Dark&quot; in the Old Tongue; most Myrddraal names come from the Trolloc
      tongue.  He is given special consideration; the ceiling of the entrance
      to the Pit of Doom does not brush his head as it does everyone else's.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Hawkwing">Hawkwing, Artur</A>, p.
      9&mdash;Hero of Legend who conquered much of the known world about a

      man besides <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A> and
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>.  His armies put down those of

      troops across the Aryth Ocean under his son,
      <A Href="#Luthair">Luthair Paendrag Mondwhin</A>, in hopes of conquering
      new lands there.  All contact with these armies ended with Hawkwing's
      death, which set off the War of the Hundred Years.  The descendants of
      the armies under Luthair have now returned to reclaim the lands of
      Hawkwing's empire in the Old World&mdash;they now call themselves the
      Seanchan.  Artur Hawkwing's real name was Artur Paendrag Tanreall; his

      it was deadlocked over four candidates who had each worn the shawl about
      fifty years; the Hall wanted an Amyrlin that was younger than the eighty
      or more years than were common.  Seaine suggested <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan
      Sanche</A>, then a young Blue sister that had worn the shawl for ten
      years; she was eventually raised.  Later, Seaine was charged by

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Keeper">Keeper of the
      Chronicles</A>, p. 328&mdash;Essentially the secretary to the
      <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>.  The Keeper is traditionally chosen
      from the same Ajah the Amyrlin was raised from, and wears a stole of the
      color of her Ajah instead of the striped stole of the Amyrlin.  The post
      was held by <A Href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</A> of the Blue Ajah until a
      coup deposed <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> and stilled both Siuan
      and Leane.  Her successor was <A Href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</A>
      of the White Ajah, despite the fact that Siuan's successor was from the
      Red.  The Keeper for the Aes Sedai who fled the Tower when

      Chronicles of their own, <A Href="#Sheriam">Sheriam Bayanar</A> of the
      Blue Ajah.  In theory, the Keeper of the Chronicles serves the Amyrlin
      and speaks for the Amyrlin; she is all but separate from her Ajah,
      although less so than the Amyrlin Seat herself.  However, both of the
      current Keepers have tried to expand their powers over the Amyrlin they
      serve, although for vastly different reasons&mdash;Alviarin is essentially
      trying to weaken Elaida and have herself or another Black sister raised
      in her place after Elaida is deposed; Sheriam tries to overstep
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> because she has a hard time thinking of

      set wards on the Waygate there, Liah got separated from the group and
      was never found.  Presuming she was dead, Rand took the group back to

      <A Href="#Sammael">Sammael</A>, he discovered that Liah was still alive,

      of thirteen Aes Sedai who declared themselves Black Ajah and fled the
      White Tower, murdering guards and even sisters in the process.  Liandrin
      was Red Ajah before turning to the Black, but her oath to the Black was
      sworn before even being raised to the Accepted (perhaps before she came
      to the Tower), so it can't really be said that she was ever Red Ajah at
      all.  When she attempted to Compel <A Href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</A>,

      Warder at one time, and left the Tower when he discoverd that he could
      talk to wolves.  He did not find any problem with the ability by itself,
      but felt the need to get away from the Red Ajah, who thought they should
      gentle him (even though there was nothing to be gentled) because of his
      ability.  Elyas helped Perrin learn that he could talk to wolves as
      well; Perrin does not necessarily like the ability, but has gotten over
      the dislike of it as well.  Elyas heard about Perrin through the wolves,
      and came to meet him to assist him in his quest.  <I>See also</I>

      black stallion.  His name means &quot;Blade&quot; in the Old Tongue.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Lan">Mandragoran, al'Lan</A>, p. 48&mdash;The
      uncrowned king of Malkier, and formerly Warder to
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>.  He is quite tall, and never gets very
      emotional&mdash;in fact, he has emotional walls all around him that he has
      been building for years.  His country, Malkier, was overrun by Trollocs
      shortly after he was born, and is now corrupted by the Great Blight.
      Lan, the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a one-man war
      against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight.  He fought Aiel
      during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status.  He was eventually
      bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at least changed
      its style).  When Lan and Moiraine brought <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>,
      <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>, <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A>,
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>, and <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> out of
      their home in the Two Rivers, he found that there was something which
      could throw his guard down, but he was the last to notice it:  affection
      for Nynaeve.  As Moiraine put it, Nynaeve was able to plant vines in
      Lan's emotional walls and break them down without him even knowing they
      were there.  The two of them are now married.  Upon Moiraine's
      death, Lan's bond was immediately transferred to
      <A Href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</A> until Nynaeve is ready to have his bond
      transferred to her.  Myrelle tried to keep Lan's status secret, but she
      was given away when she tried to buy one of Lan's favorite foods, coin
      peppers, too far south (they are very popular in Shienar, and were in
      Malkier before it fell to the Blight, but don't grow well in southern
      climates).  Upon learning of where Lan was,
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> sent him to Ebou Dar to serve as a Warder
      for Nynaeve.  He now travels with his wife and the group of Aes Sedai

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Nynaeve">Mandragoran, el'Nynaeve ti al'Meara</A>,
      p. 48&mdash;Young woman from Emond's Field, now an Aes Sedai of the Yellow
      Ajah.  She was the Wisdom of her village, the youngest such ever chosen
      in Emond's Field.  She left when four of her villagers were taken away
      from the Two Rivers by <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> and
      <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>.  While the group traveled away from her home and
      toward her new life, Nynaeve made several discoveries:  she could
      channel the One Power, and had already done so without really knowing
      what she was doing; she developed feelings for Lan Mandragoran,
      Moiraine's Warder and the uncrowned king of the now dead nation Malkier;
      and she has a major role to play, as all of her younger friends in the
      group do, in the years to come.  She is very strong in the One Power;
      only a select few who were alive during the Age of Legends could match
      her.  When she arrived in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted without any
      tenure as a novice, despite not being able to even <I>sense</I> the True
      Source unless angry, a result of her having to learn some minimal
      control of her ability without teaching.  She was sent on a false
      mission by <A Href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</A> on which she was almost
      leashed by the Seanchan as <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> was.  After she
      returned to the Tower, <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> sent her on a
      mission to hunt down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while
      hunting them in Tanchico, she encountered
      <A Href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</A> and managed to better her in a duel
      of the Power.  Moghedien escaped, but two encounters later Nynaeve once
      again managed to get the better of her, leashing her with an
      <I>a'dam</I> in <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>.  Nynaeve took Moghedien with her
      to seek out <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> and <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A>
      while they were fighting each other, and at the last moment before
      Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin to ash with a giant
      weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could draw to produce it;
      the distraction was enough for Rand to regain control of himself and
      destroy Rahvin with balefire.  Nynaeve then kept Moghedien under control
      with a modified <I>a'dam</I> in Salidar.  Nynaeve wished to become Aes
      Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she thinks the Tower meddles in
      the affairs of nations far too much, and wants no part of it.  She is
      determined to Heal anything short of death, and has already managed to
      Heal gentling.  Nynaeve felt bad when Moiraine died, because her first
      thought was not of her, but that now Lan was free from their bond.  She
      was not told that Lan's bond had been passed to
      <A Href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</A> the moment of Moiraine's death.  She and
      Lan are now married, and the plan is for Lan's bond to pass to her as
      soon as she and Myrelle can get together.  <I>See also</I>

      Second Captain in the Companions.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Corgaide">Marendevin, Corgaide</A>, p.
      271&mdash;Grave-faced, gray-haired woman who orders servants in the Sun
      Palace.  Her official title is Holder of the Keys, and she is
      essentially in charge of all servants in the palace.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Beonin">Marinye, Beonin</A>, p. 329&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Gray Ajah.  She is pretty, has honey-colored hair, and grew
      up in Tarabon.  Her blue-gray eyes seem to constantly look startled.
      Nothing seems to surprise her, though, and
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> thinks she would not believe the Sun would
      come up unless she saw it herself, and if one morning it did not, she
      would just take it to confirm that she was correct to demand proof.  She
      was one of the six sisters in Salidar that have most of the authority,
      despite not being part of the Hall of the Tower.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Marline">Marline</A>, p.
      213&mdash;Wise One with purple twilight eyes.  She comes with
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Arymilla">Marne, Arymilla</A>, p.
      550&mdash;Brown-eyed Andoran noble with a habit of fainting.  She opposed
      <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A> during the Succession.  The only real
      reason <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> kept her around in Caemlyn was to push
      others into supporting <A Href="#Dyelin">Dyelin</A>; no one wanted Andor
      in the hands of Arymilla.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Masond">Masond, Jak</A>, p.
      421&mdash;Short, stocky commander of <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s troops.  He
      moves suddenly and surprisingly quickly.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Ethenielle">Materasu, Ethenielle Kirukan</A>, p.
      15&mdash;Holder of the Throne of the Clouds of Kandor&mdash;that is, the Queen of
      Kandor.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Verin">Mathwin, Verin</A>, p. 25&mdash;Aes Sedai of
      the Brown Ajah who accompanied <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>,
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>, and <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> back
      from Falme to Tar Valon.  Her Warder is named
      <A Href="#Tomas">Tomas</A>.  She is more interested in current events
      than the average Brown; most of them could not care less what happened
      now, only what happened years ago.  She gave Egwene the twisted stone
      ring <I>ter'angreal</I> to assist her in Dreaming, and also once told
      <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A> that there was really no need to keep
      her in the Tower until she learned to control her ability when she was a
      novice, since she would never be able to do much with it anyway.  When
      Verin went to the Two Rivers with <A Href="#Alanna">Alanna</A>, they
      helped to fight the Trollocs that attacked, and when they left they
      brought a half-dozen young women with them who could channel, including
      <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>'s sister <A Href="#Bode">Bode</A>.  When she and
      Alanna reached Caemlyn, they found that the Tower had been broken, and
      decided to side with the Salidar embassy when it reached town.  Verin is
      quite old&mdash;her hair is starting to turn gray, which to an Aes Sedai
      means she is quite old indeed.  Verin is a native of Far Madding.
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Tomas">Tomas</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Joline">Maza, Joline</A>, p.
      51&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah.  She was a Sitter for the Green,
      appointed after one of the Green's sitters left for Salidar.
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A> asked her to resign her position after only
      weeks and sent her to Ebou Dar to meet with <A Href="#Tylin">Queen
      Tylin</A> of Altara.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Cian">do Mehon a'Macansa, Cian</A>,
      p. 355&mdash;Murandian lord with a greasy, curled mustache.  He is stocky.

      <A Href="#Pelivar">Pelivar</A> and <A Href="#Arathelle">Arathelle</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Meira">Meira</A>, p. 244&mdash;Wise
      One of the Shaido Aiel, loyal to <A Href="#Sevanna">Sevanna</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Cadsuane">Melaidhrin, Cadsuane</A>, p. 30&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Green Ajah with iron-gray hair.  She retired to a rose
      garden in northern Ghealdan, but has since left it due to the difficulty
      of growing decent roses with the weather they way it was.  She refused
      two appointments to the Hall of the Tower, when refusing even once is
      unheard of.  She also refused to become head of the Green Ajah.  It is
      said that she has had more Warders than most sisters have had shoes.
      She has more strength than anyone in a thousand years except
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>, <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>, and
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>.  Although a Green, she has confronted and
      captured more men that can channel than any other woman; unknown to
      most, the men she captures tend to live longer after being gentled than
      the average.  She is somewhat of a living legend among Aes Sedai.
      According to <A Href="#Min">Min</A>, Cadsuane will teach
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> and the Asha'man something&mdash;they will not like
      it, but they will have to learn it.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Suroth">Meldarath, Suroth Sabelle</A>, p.
      154&mdash;High Lady of Seanchan, leader of Those Who Come Before.  She has
      her head shaven on the sides and long, black hair in the middle.  This
      is the typical Seanchan style for those &quot;of the Blood&quot;.
      Suroth is determined to redeem herself after
      <A Href="#Turak">High Lord Turak</A>'s mishap at Falme&mdash;she does not
      want to have to explain a failure that was not hers to the
      <A Href="#Empress">Empress</A>.  She tried to gather all of the Seanchan
      ships that fled Falme so they wouldn't go back home yet; she plans to
      attempt to retake the mainland again, destroying the man that threw them
      back the first time (<A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>).
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Sharina">Melloy, Sharina</A>, p.
      587&mdash;Grandmother recruited as a novice along the way from Salidar
      to Tar Valon.  She has more potential than
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>.  <I>There is a distinct possibility that
      this Sharina is the same one as the Aes Sedai advisor to Nynaeve and
      <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A> from Nynaeve's test for being raised to
      Accepted.</I>
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Memara">Memara</A>, p. 23&mdash;Aes

      <A Href="#Tenobia">Tenobia</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Mendan">Mendan</A>, p.
      27&mdash;Broad-shouldered Aiel who guards <A Href="#Verin">Verin</A> against
      anyone who might misunderstand her position in the Aiel camp.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Meralda">Meralda</A>, p. 195&mdash;One
      of the Cairhienin women who tries to imitate the Aiel Maidens of the
      Spear, only using swords instead.  She is dark and stocky, and almost as
      tall as <A Href="#Faile">Faile</A>.  From Tear.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Meri">Meri</A>, p. 311&mdash;One of
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>'s maids as the <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin
      Seat</A>.  She has a pinched nose, dark eyes, and black hair.  She was
      chosen by <A Href="#Romanda">Romanda</A>.  She seems to have wandered
      off.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Thom">Merrilin, Thomdril (Thom)</A>, 130&mdash;Gleeman
      who came to Emond's Field on Winternight just before the Trollocs came.
      He is quite the ladies' man.  Thom is good at juggling, sleight-of-hand,
      and all kinds of other tricks.  He also carries several concealed knives
      up his sleeves, in his boots, and in various other locations on his
      body; this practice seems to have spread from Thom to
      <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>, <A Href="#Min">Min</A>, and
      <A Href="#Faile">Faile</A>.  Thom was originally a bard in
      <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A>'s Royal Court, and for a time after
      her husband <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</A> died, he was the
      Queen's lover.  During his run from a Fade at Shadar Logoth, he was
      injured, and now walks with a limp because of it.  Thom is getting old,
      such that he is starting to realize that he can't do the backflips and
      other stunts he used to do.  He accompanied <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>
      and <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> on their travels as per
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>'s request, despite the fact that he has
      never felt comfortable around Aes Sedai since his nephew,
      <A Href="#Owyn">Owyn</A>, was gentled by the Red Ajah.  Thom is an
      expert in the Game of Houses; in fact, his girlfried Dena was killed by
      Cairhienin soldiers because they thought he was trying to play <I>Daes
      Daemar</I> against the Royal House.  <I>See also</I>

      who <A Href="#Elyas">Elyas</A> lived with for a year.  She is from

      knife scar for his trouble....
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Mesaana">Mesaana</A>, p. 497&mdash;One
      of the Forsaken.  During the Age of Legends, Mesaana was told
      she was unfit to do research at the Collam Daan, but was capable of
      teaching others.  She spent her years teaching until the Bore was opened
      and she dedicated her life to the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>.  During
      the War of Power, she created &quot;schools&quot; for the children, at
      which she taught the children to spy on their parents and other such
      things.  After her release from the Bore, Mesaana set herself up in the
      White Tower, where she could control events without anyone suspecting
      she was behind them.  She has been cooperating with
      <A Href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</A> to some extent, and has taught
      <A Href="#Alviarin">Alviarin</A> to Travel.  She was displeased that
      Alviarin had ordered <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A> beaten.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="MHael">M'Hael</A>, p. 293&mdash;Title

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Talene">Minly, Talene</A>, p.
      499&mdash;Sitter for the Green Ajah in Tar Valon.  She has golden hair, and
      has a statuesque air.  She was friends with <A Href="#Seaine">Seaine</A>
      before the rift that formed between the Ajahs went up.  She earned more
      punishments as a novice than any other woman in history.  Quite possibly
      of the Black Ajah&mdash;she refused to re-swear the Three Oaths and deny
      being a Darkfriend.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Miraj">Miraj, Kennar</A>, p.
      457&mdash;Captain-General of a Seanchan patrol.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Miren">Miren</A>, p. 533&mdash;One of
      <A Href="#Min">Min</A>'s aunts.  She said that one of three lies that
      men will believe from a woman is that she likes being held just as much
      as having sex.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Novices">Mistress of Novices</A>, p. 328&mdash;The Aes
      Sedai who is in charge of training novices in the White Tower.  The post
      was held by <A Href="#Sheriam">Sheriam Bayanar</A> of the Blue Ajah
      until a coup that deposed <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> chased her
      out of the Tower.  The post is now held by
      <A Href="#Silviana">Silviana Brehon</A> in Tar Valon and
      <A Href="#Tiana">Tiana Noselle</A> among the Aes Sedai who fled to
      Salidar.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Tylin">Mitsobar, Tylin Quintara</A>,
      p. 51&mdash;By the Grace of the Light, Queen of Altara, Mistress of the
      Four Winds, Guardian of the Sea of Storms, High Seat of House Mitsobar.
      Her kingdom is small, and she only rules a portion of it; the rest is
      governed by nobles who are not necessarily loyal to her.  She is the
      second from her House to sit on the throne&mdash;this is the maximum
      traditionally, and the only House to hold it for four generations fell
      so fast from power that it could not recover.  She is advised by
      <A Href="#Merilille">Merilille Ceandevin</A> of the Gray Ajah.  She is
      a widow, and does not plan to marry again, although she is always on
      the lookout for a lover....
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Modarra">Modarra</A>, p. 245&mdash;Wise One of the

      lean.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Ilyena">Moerelle, Ilyena Therin</A>, p. 436&mdash;Wife
      of <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin
      Telamon</A> during the Age of Legends and the War of the Shadow.  She
      has light hair similar in color to <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> and
      <A Href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</A>.  According to the memories of Lews
      Therin's that flash through <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s head, Ilyena
      never flashed her temper at Lews Therin when she got angry at herself.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Moghedien">Moghedien</A>, p. 52&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  Her name means &quot;Spider&quot; in the Old Tongue.  She
      always works from safety, attacks from safety, and will run unless she
      can do so.  She developed a command of <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I> that
      surpassed even <A Href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</A>'s mastery&mdash;in the real
      world, Lanfear was more powerful, but even she could not top Moghedien
      in the World of Dreams.  After being released from the Bore, Moghedien
      eventually found herself in Tanchico, in the Palace of the Panarch of
      Tarabon.  While there, she chanced upon <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve
      al'Meara</A>, who was trying to save the Panarch at the time and take
      the seal on the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>'s prison from its hold in
      the Palace.  She and Nynaeve fought in a duel to the last, and Nynaeve
      managed to better Moghedien, much to the surprise of both of them.  She
      managed to escape Nynaeve's tied off shield, and on their next
      encounter, this one in <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>, she ripped
      <A Href="#Birgitte">Birgitte</A>'s soul out of the World of Dreams after
      Birgitte almost killed her.  On her third encounter with Nynaeve,
      Nynaeve managed to trap Moghedien with an <I>a'dam</I>.  Moghedien
      remained bound by that <I>a'dam</I> in Salidar, disguised as
      <A Href="#Marigan">Marigan</A>, but was released by
      <A Href="#Halima">Halima</A>.  Halima was actually one of the Forsaken,
      and she took Moghedien to Shayol Ghul to be bound by a

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Luthair">Mondwhin, Luthair Paendrag</A>, p.
      443&mdash;Son of <A Href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</A>.  He led the forces
      across the Aryth Ocean.  When they landed there, he led them to conquer
      the continent they found for themselves, and declared himself Emperor.
      His descendants are the Seanchan &quot;of the Blood,&quot; and the rest
      of the Seanchan are descended from his troops and the native
      inhabitants.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Mordeth">Mordeth, Jeraal</A>, p.
      523&mdash;Name used by <A Href="#Fain">Padan Fain</A> as a disguise to
      be one of <A Href="#Toram">Toram Riatin</A>'s advisors.  It is the name
      of the man whose soul controls about half of Fain's mind.  Mordeth
      became a counsellor in Aridhol during the Trolloc
      Wars.  He advised that to defeat the Shadow, Aridhol must be harder than
      the Shadow, less trusting, more cruel.  Slowly it became so, until
      finally the city was, if not darker than the Shadow, as dark.  The city
      finally turned on itself, consumed itself, tainting every grain of sand,
      every rock, every sip of water with its hatred.  Mordeth's soul remained
      in the city, now called Shadar Logoth ("Where the Shadow Waits") for
      millenia&mdash;he could not leave the city unless he accompanied a person to
      the city walls or had them carry something from the city to the outside
      world.  Strangely enough, both of these things happened at the same
      time, when <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A> carried the ruby-handled
      dagger from the city while <A Href="#Fain">Padan Fain</A> accompanied
      Mordeth out of the city at about the same time.  Mordeth attempted to
      consume Fain's soul while the dagger tried to consume Mat's.  In Fain's
      case, the attempt to consume his soul was not completely
      successful&mdash;instead, the two souls merged to create something more evil
      than either Mordeth or Fain alone.  Fain now feels incomplete without
      the tainted dagger that was removed from the city.  Mordeth, Fain, or
      whatever you wish to call him has since deserted Toram.  <I>See also</I>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Moridin">Moridin</A>, p.
      42&mdash;Name given to the reincarnation of one of the Forsaken.  His name
      means &quot;Death&quot; in the Old Tongue; no one deserves the name
      more.  He is fond of using the True Power, the power drawn directly from
      the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>; the <I>saa</I> have already appeared
      in his eyes, yet he still controls his use of the True Power (most
      thought it impossible to avoid drawing too much of it once the
      <I>saa</I> appeared).  <I>There is a debate as to whether Moridin is the
      reincarnation of <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A> or just another
      character.  In my mind, Jordan has dropped enough clues to conclusively
      decide that they are one in the same soul.  See also</I>

      part of the Hall of the Tower.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Delana">Mosalaine, Delana</A>, p.
      312&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Black Ajah, openly a Sitter for the Gray Ajah in
      the &quot;Little Tower.&quot;  She is the only Sitter that
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> thinks she can count on.  She is round, and
      has a deep voice for a woman and pale hair.  She is from Shienar.
      She has no Warder.  Egwene might be more than a little worried if she
      knew that the only Sitter that does as she asks is Black Ajah.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Daigian">Moseneillin, Daigian</A>,
      p. 269&mdash;Plump, pale Aes Sedai of the White Ajah with long, black hair.
      She is the youngest daughter of a lesser House in Cairhien.  Many

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alanna">Mosvani, Alanna</A>, p.
      274&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah.  She is dark and slender with black

      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> (whom she bonded against his will) and
      <A Href="#Ihvon">Ihvon</A>; her other, <A Href="#Owein">Owein</A>, died
      in the Two Rivers while scouting the Whitecloak camp.  She later found
      that bonding Rand was a grievious error; not only is it impossible to
      compel him in comparison to most Warders (she compared it to attempting
      to uproot an oak tree with her bare hands), but she constantly feels the
      pain he experiences from the wound in his side, perhaps even more
      severely than he feels it.

      who claimed the Sun Throne when <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> was taken
      prisoner by Aes Sedai.  When he returned, he dethroned her and stripped
      her of all her titles and estates.  Rather than living in shame, she

      During the War of the Shadow, he was one of the Shadow's greatest
      military commanders.  His name means &quot;Destroyer of Hope&quot; in
      the Old Tongue.  After being released from the Bore, he took up
      residence on the Council of Nine in Illian as
      <A Href="#Brend">Lord Brend</A>, and effectively ruled the country.  He
      wore a battle scar that he got while fighting
      <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A> during the War of the Shadow.
      He could have had it Healed, but kept it to remind himself of what Lews
      Therin had done to him.  He is believed dead at the hands of Mashadar.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Siuan">Sanche, Siuan</A>, p. 309&mdash;Aes Sedai of
      the Blue Ajah.  Born in Tear to a fisherman, she was sent to the White
      Tower on the first boat to leave after she discovered she had the
      ability to channel inborn, according to Tairen law.  As a novice, she
      was good friends with <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine Damodred</A>, and was
      present at <A Href="#Gitara">Gitara Moroso</A>'s Foretelling of the
      Rebirth of the <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>.  After being raised to the
      shawl, she joined the Blue Ajah to dedicate her life to finding and
      guiding the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>, and eventually came to
      lead the Blues' network of eyes-and-ears (i.e. spies) before being
      raised to the <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>.  She was only thirty
      years old when raised to the Amyrlin Seat, making her the youngest
      Amyrlin to date.  She was also one of the strongest Amyrlins in recent
      history, and one of the most feared among the rulers of nations.  Her
      blue-eyed stare was feared by all.  When her twenty-year connection to
      the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> was discovered, she and her
      <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A>, <A Href="#Leane">Leane
      Sharif</A>, were deposed and stilled by a group of sisters loyal to
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida a'Roihan</A>.  Siuan hoped to regain some of
      her previous standing in the new Tower that separated from Elaida&mdash;her
      knowledge of the Blue Ajah spy network is hard to match, and she knows
      much that she thinks would be of use.  In one of her viewings,
      <A Href="#Min">Min</A> saw that Siuan would have to remain close by to
      <A Href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</A>&mdash;if she did not, both of them would
      die.  Siuan did not initially know what she meant, but now realizes that
      she is growing to love the gray-haired man who leads the Salidar army.
      She had a Warder named <A Href="#Alric">Alric</A>, but he died when
      she was deposed.  After coming to Salidar,
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> discovered how to restore Siuan's ability
      to channel, at least partially.  This resurrected a part of her bond
      with Alric, but did not bring back her former strength, or her binding
      by the Oath Rod.  She can now lie as well as any child.  She now serves
      as an &ldquo;advisor&rdquo; to the new Amyrlin in Salidar,
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A>, but though she puts on a
      fa&ccedil;ade of hating the work, she is actually one of Egwene's
      foremost agents.  The fact that she is Aes Sedai, not to mention one who
      was stilled and Healed again, makes other sisters tend to be oblivious
      to this fact.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Alric">Alric</A>;

      opposed <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A> during the Succession.
      <A Href="#Dyelin">Dyelin</A> exiled her from Caemlyn, as Morgase did

      dark for an Andorman.  During the Succession, Jared's House opposed
      <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A>; after she became Queen, he was only
      allowed into the Palace on state occasions.  When

      control of Caemlyn until he could find <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>,
      Jarid tried to make himself fall into favor, thinking he could gain

      night to help with her chronic headaches.  Since she is actually
      <A Href="#Arangar">Aran'gar</A>, a reincarnated Forsaken who channels
      <I>saidin</I> despite being female, it is likely that she is
      <I>causing</I> Egwene's headaches, and then making them subside in order

      conscripted <A Href="#Meri">Meri</A> into service.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Semirhage">Semirhage</A>, p. 265&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  During the Age of Legends, she was one of the best Healers
      ever known.  She was called to all corners of the world Heal people that
      others thought beyond help.  However, she was sadistic; she exacted a
      price in the form of pain from her subjects in return for her Healing
      services.  Most thought the pain or anguish she exacted from them was a
      small price to pay for being alive, but eventually the Hall of Servants
      found out about her practices and gave her the choice of being severed
      or bound with the Power, never again to know her &quot;pleasures.&quot;
      She chose instead to pledge for the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>, and
      created one of the most oppressive and pain-filled areas of Shadow
      control during the entire War of Power.  After being freed from the
      Bore, Semirhage went in service to the Dark One by extracting
      information from captured Borderlanders and Aes Sedai.  She also sent
      the Trollocs to the Stone of Tear to battle those that
      <A Href="#Sammael">Sammael</A> sent.  She is as tall as most men, and
      wears black most of the time&mdash;perhaps because
      <A Href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</A> always wore white.  It is often joked (or
      used to be, when the Forsaken were still bound) that when it rained
      during the daylight that the Dark One was beating her.

      <A Href="#Couladin">Couladin</A>.  She has green eyes.  She knows that
      the easiest way to power for herself is to attach herself to men who
      already hold power; she even envisioned marrying
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> (against his will) to gain power through him.
      She is currently leading her clan (and any Aiel deserters that joined
      her) through Kinslayer's Dagger.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Dark">Shai'tan</A>, p. 485&mdash;Real name for the
      Dark One.  At the moment of Creation, Shai'tan was imprisoned by the
      <A Href="#Creator">Creator</A> at Shayol Ghul.  This prison kept him
      from touching the world until it was bored into by Aes Sedai during the
      Age of Legends.  This hole, called the Bore, allowed the Dark One to
      once again touch the world, causing new outbreaks of war, treachery,
      violence, and crime.  The attempt to free the Dark One completely
      resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the War of Power by some,
      especially those on the Shadow's side), during which a number of
      important leaders forsook the Light and gave their lives to the Dark
      One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of the
      most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  The War of the Shadow
      did not end until <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A>, the
      <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>, and his Hundred Companions Traveled to
      Shayol Ghul and re-sealed the Dark One back into his prison, trapping
      the Forsaken with him.  At the moment of sealing, Shai'tan lashed out at
      those sealing the prison, driving them insane and tainting <I>saidin</I>
      itself, the male half of the True Source, dooming all male Aes Sedai to
      madness as well and starting the Time of Madness.  These seals are
      weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the Dark One is
      once again able to exert influence on the world.  These seals were
      scattered throughout the world by Aes Sedai during the Breaking of the
      World.  In order of when they were found, they were placed:  1) At the
      Eye of the World (broken when it was found); 2) in the hands of
      <A Href="#Domon">Bayle Domon</A>, later pilfered by
      <A Href="#Turak">High Lord Turak</A> of the Seanchan (broken at the
      battle of Falme), 3) On Seanchan, part of High Lord Turak's collection
      (broken at the battle at Falme); 4) In the Great Hold at the Stone of
      Tear (still intact); 5) In the Panarch's Palace in Tanchico (broken
      enroute to Salidar); 6) One in Rhuidean (still intact), and 7) Found by
      <A Href="#Taim">Mazrim Taim</A> on a small farm in Saldaea (still
      intact).  Despite being made of <I>cuendillar</I>, the three that remain
      unbroken can be cut with a knife and would break by a fall from a table.
      The Dark One is also referred to by other euphemisms, including
      Sightblinder, Lord of the Grave, Father of Lies, Grassburner,
      Leafblighter, Heartsbane, Soulsbane, Lord of the Twilight, Father of
      Storms, Shepherd of the Night, and (among Darkfriends) the Great Lord of
      the Dark.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Leane">Sharif, Leane</A>, p.
      314&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah.  She grew up in Arad Doman, and has
      coppery skin.  Just as her family members were training her in the
      seductive ways of Domani women, Leane found that her life would take a
      different direction:  she could channel <I>saidar</I>, and would do so
      with or without teaching.  She became an Aes Sedai, a member of the Blue
      Ajah, and was eventually raised to <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the
      Chronicles</A> under <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>.  During the coup
      led by <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida a'Roihan</A> and
      <A Href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</A> that deposed Siuan, Leane was
      thrown in the dungeon and stilled.  Leane tried turning to her seductive
      side to try to replace what she lost in stilling; she was out of
      practice, but did well enough.  She eventually convinced the Aes Sedai
      in Salidar to let her stay with them and maintain the network of
      eyes-and-ears she kept in Tar Valon as Keeper.  She was later Healed by
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>, and restored to some of her former
      capacity for using the One Power.  The Hall of the Tower in Salidar
      decided that since she had been stilled, she was no longer Aes Sedai for
      that time and thus all of her titles and choice of Ajah were null and
      void.  Instead of petitioning to re-enter the Blue Ajah, she asked the
      Green Ajah if it would accept her; it did.  <I>See also</I>

      <A Href="#Gaebril">Gaebril</A> had the guards swear new oaths to the
      laws and customs of Andor (instead of to the Queen), Tallanvor swore
      them but immediately went back to his room and reswore the old oath in
      the old style (cutting his arm with his sword, indicating that his blood
      will be shed before the Queen's will).  He loves his queen more than his
      life, and now serves as her personal bodyguard.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Tamarla">Tamarla</A>, p. 58&mdash;Lean,
      olive-skinned Kinswoman.  She is very old, and grew up in Altara.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Dyelin">Taravin, Dyelin</A>, p.
      396&mdash;<A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>'s cousin and heir to her throne if
      she dies without female children.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Tauan">Tauan</A>, p. 154&mdash;A
      <I>morat'raken</I> who died at Aes Sedai hands.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Pevara">Tazanovni, Pevara</A>, p. 499&mdash;Sitter
      for the Red Ajah in Tar Valon.  She was friends with
      <A Href="#Seaine">Seaine</A> as a novice; the two maintained the
      friendship, although it was a bit restrained due to the constraints that
      the Red Ajah puts on its members about making friends outside the Ajah.
      She is short for a Kandori, and quite plump.  She has dark eyes.  She
      was once punished for voicing her desire to have a Warder; later, as a
      Sitter, when she was safer from the wrath of the Ajah, she openly
      suggested that Warders would make the job of a Red sister much easier.
      Seaine thinks she would have been happier as a Green.  When she was
      small, many members of her family were killed by Darkfriends; it is for
      this reason that Seaine confides in her about searching for Darkfriends
      in the White Tower, as well as the reason she chose the Red Ajah; she
      thought it would be the way surest to let her hunt down Darkfriends.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Telabin">Telabin</A>, p.
      194&mdash;Owner of a palace with a garden that <A Href="#Alliandre">Queen
      Alliandre</A> of Ghealdan frequents.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Lews">Telamon, Lews Therin</A>, p. 286&mdash;The
      <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>, Breaker of the World.  He was perhaps the
      greatest man who ever lived, and the most powerful Aes Sedai in recorded
      history.  During the War of the Shadow, he led the forces of the Light
      against the Forsaken, and led the final stroke which re-sealed the
      <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A> back into his prison.  Unfortunately,
      during this stroke he was driven insane by the Dark One's touch,
      eventually killing his wife <A Href="#Ilyena">Ilyena</A>, his children,
      and everyone he loved, as well as anyone who carried a drop of his
      blood.  For this act, people remember him with a new name:
      <A Href="#Kinslayer">Kinslayer</A>.  After he had done this,
      <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A> gave him his sanity back long enough
      for him to realize what he had done; Lews Therin killed himself by
      drawing on <I>saidin</I> too heavily, causing a mountain to form on the
      spot where he stood.  This mountain is called Dragonmount, and is near
      the present-day city of Tar Valon.  It is unfortunate that the name of
      one of the greatest men to ever live is now synonymous with evil, for
      Lews Therin killed his family due to the Dark One's influence, but
      without Lews Therin there may not have been a world left in which to
      kill them.  Lews Therin's voice sometimes speaks inside
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s head, offering advice or sobbing over lost
      women, but is getting more and more vocal.  It even tries to seize
      control of <I>saidin</I> sometimes, much to Rand's fear.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Salita">Toranes, Salita</A>, p.
      331&mdash;Dark-skinned Sitter for the Yellow Ajah among the rebel Aes Sedai.
      She is from Tear, and is almost as dark as the Sea Folk.  She was raised
      to a Sitter after the sisters banded together in Salidar.  She suggested
      a tax on the towns the Aes Sedai passed through to raise money for the
      ever-growing army.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Torval">Torval, Peral</A>, p.

      Tarabon.  When he first met <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>, he tried to pick a

      could cause any trouble.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Ellorien">Traemane, Ellorien</A>,
      p. 550&mdash;Andoran lady, leader of a strong House that supported
      <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A> during the Succession, and one of
      Morgase's best friends.  Morgase exiled her from Caemlyn as per
      <A Href="#Gaebril">Gaebril</A>'s suggestion; when Ellorien demanded to
      know why, Morgase had her flogged.  <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> was
      named after her grandmother.  Morgase hopes she will forgive her for
      what she did and support her when she comes to Andor to reclaim her
      throne, or at least support <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> in her claim.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Seonid">Traighan, Seonid</A>, p.
      159&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah.  She grew up in Cairhien.  She was
      part of Salidar's embassy to <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>.  She now travels
      with <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> and company.  She has two Warders.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Elayne">Trakand, Elayne</A>, p. 47&mdash;The
      Daughter-Heir of Andor, now Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah.  She is the
      daughter of <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A> and her late husband,
      <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail</A>, and sister to
      <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>.  She is also half-sister to
      <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A>, although she would rather not be reminded of
      this fact; she thinks Galad virtuous to the point of fault, and does not
      really like him.  She has considerable potential in the One Power, and
      is one of the strongest Aes Sedai in a thousand years or more, possibly
      since the Age of Legends, with the exceptions of
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>, <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>,
      <A Href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</A>, and some Sea Folk trainees.  She has
      red-gold curly hair.  During her stay in the Stone of Tear, Elayne
      realized she loved <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, and told him how
      she felt; he felt similarly.  She had no idea at the time what
      <A Href="#Min">Min</A> meant about &quot;having to share him,&quot; but
      now knows about Min's viewing of Rand with the three women's heads,
      indicating that Rand will fall in love with Min, Elayne, and
      <A Href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</A>, and they with him.  Later, when she
      and Nynaeve had trouble with <A Href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</A>, Elayne
      ended up bonding <A Href="#Birgitte">Birgitte</A> as her Warder (despite
      being only Accepted) in order to save Birgitte's life.  Elayne is
      currently in Ebou Dar, looking for the Bowl of the Winds, a
      <I>ter'angreal</I> that she believes will fix the weather.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Gawyn">Trakand, Gawyn</A>, p. 322&mdash;Son of
      <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A> of Andor and brother to
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>.  He will become First Prince of the Sword
      when Elayne becomes Queen.  He and his half-brother
      <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A> went to train with the Warders in the White
      Tower, as all sons of Andoran queens have for centuries, and both now
      possess considerable skill with the sword.  During the chaos that
      erupted after <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>'s deposition, Gawyn
      formed a band of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders
      except Galad, who are called the Younglings.  The Younglings fought back
      against their teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and
      <A Href="#Leane">Leane</A> from their imprisonment.  Gawyn himself
      killed Hammar and Coulin, the men in charge of teaching the sword and
      for his personal training, respectively, both of which were
      Blademasters&mdash;few Warders are as good as they were, and Gawyn managed to
      kill both of them.  With recent developments, Gawyn does not know which
      party to support&mdash;he believes that anyone who opposed Tower Law by
      trying to free Siuan and Leane was wrong, but at the same time he does
      not know all the facts surrounding the change in leadership.  In fact,
      his sister Elayne and her friends <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve
      al'Meara</A> and <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A> side with those
      who broke from the Tower, and Egwene, the woman he wants to marry, is
      their new leader.  He believes the rumor that <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>
      killed his mother, and only refrains from killing him because Egwene
      made him promise not to.  His sign is a white boar.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Morgase">Trakand, Morgase</A>, p. 179&mdash;By the
      Grace of the Light, Queen of Andor, Defender of the Realm, High Seat of
      House Trakand.  Mother of <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> and
      <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>.  She married <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail
      Damodred</A>, a prince of Cairhien, to further solidify her claim to the
      Throne of Andor and keep peace between the two nations; when
      <A Href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</A> disappeared, Morgase made the best
      claim to succeed her, and married her widower to gain the support that
      would be gained by such action.  Taringail was Elayne's and Gawyn's
      father; he died when they were young.  Morgase has since gone through
      several lovers, including <A Href="#Thom">Thomdril Merrilin</A>, a
      former court-bard; <A Href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</A>, her First Prince
      of the Sword and Captain of the Guards; and most recently
      <A Href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</A>, a man who led the faction that
      stilled the riots in Caemlyn that sprang up on Morgase's trip to Tar
      Valon to inquire about Elayne's whereabouts.  Thom was exiled from the
      city of Caemlyn when he started telling her what he really thought of
      some of her plans, her relationship with Bryne ebbed away until finally
      Gaebril told her to exile him too, and Gaebril eventually chased Morgase
      herself out of the city when she found he was usurping her power.  The
      Daughter-Heir of Andor is traditionally trained by Aes Sedai in the
      White Tower, and Morgase underwent novice training to keep the tradition
      alive.  She was given the gift of a Great Serpent ring despite not being
      Accepted, and still wears it on her left hand.  She was previously
      advised by <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</A> of the Red
      Ajah, who is now the <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A> in Tar Valon.
      When Morgase discovered that Gaebril (who, unbeknownst to her, was
      actually <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A>) meant to usurp her throne, she
      left, and when she learned that the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>
      had taken over Caemlyn and none of her former supporters would give her
      aid, she fled to Amadicia to get help from the only place she thought
      she could:  <A Href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</A> and the Children of the
      Light.  She is not aware that <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> only wants to
      give her country back to her, not to mention believes that she is dead.
      If she made her presence known, she would no doubt have her country back
      in one piece and all would be well, but as royalty she believes she must
      work on her own and trust no one.  The entire world believes Morgase
      dead except for a select few.  She is currently in hiding, using her
      mother's name, <A Href="#Dorlain">Maighdin</A> to avoid instant
      recognition.  Her sign is three golden keys.  <I>See also</I>
