<H2><A Name="A">A</A></H2>
  <Li><I><A Class="name" Name="Aan">Aan'allein</A></I>, p. 230&mdash;Aiel
      name for <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>.  It means &ldquo;One Man,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;The Man Alone,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Man Who is an Entire
      People&rdquo; in the Old Tongue.  Lan's story is well-known and
      well-respected among the Aiel.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Admira">Master Admira</A>, p.
      592&mdash;Merchant who happens to be in Far Madding when
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> is there.  He is worried about the troubles in
      Andor.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Adria">Adria</A>, p. 338&mdash;One of
      several young girls that <A Href="#Olver">Olver</A> likes.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Ailron">Ailron</A>, p. 95&mdash;King of
      Amadicia until the Seanchan invaded.  He was not as strong as most kings
      due to the control of the Children of the Light&mdash;in fact, he had almost
      no real power at all.  During the invasion, he took his army to engage
      the invaders near Jeramel; they were slaughtered, and Ailron himself was
      captured.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Niall">Niall, Pedron</A>;
      <A Href="#Valda">Valda, Eamon</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Turak">Aladon, Turak</A>, p. 417&mdash;High
      Lord of Seanchan and commander of the Forerunners before his death in
      Falme.  He was killed there when <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> bested him in
      a swordfight.  He was a Blademaster, and was quite stunned when Rand was
      able to match him.  He kept a collection of rare <I>cuendillar</I>
      objects, including (thanks in part to looting <A Href="#Bayle">Bayle
      Domon</A>'s ship) two seals on the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>'s
      prison.  Both of these seals broke when the Seanchan were pushed back
      into the sea.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Lem">al'Dai, Lem</A>, p.
      154&mdash;Horse-faced man from the Two Rivers.  He has a gap in his front
      teeth from a fistfight with a wool merchant's guard long ago.  He seems
      to like getting into fistfights.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Lacile">Aldorwin, Lacile</A>, p. 115&mdash;Tiny woman,
      taken captive by the Shaido along with <A Href="#Faile">Faile</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Algwyn">Algwyn</A>, p. 328&mdash;Last
      Emperor of Seanchan.  All subsequent holders of the Crystal Throne were
      female.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Empress">Empress</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Furen">Alharra, Furen</A>, p.
      163&mdash;One of <A Href="#Seonid">Seonid</A>'s Warders; from Tear.  He has
      graying, curly, black hair and dark skin.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Seonid">Traighan, Seonid</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alivia">Alivia</A>, p. 205&mdash;Seanchan
      <I>damane</I> captured by Asha'man.  She was afraid of freedom because
      she feared being captured again.  She has been collared since she was
      thirteen or fourteen, and has been <I>damane</I> for over four hundred
      years.  She is considerably stronger in the One Power than
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>, and a little bit taller.  She has fine
      lines at the corners of her blue eyes and white streaks in her blonde
      hair.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Doesine">Alwain, Doesine</A>, p. 17&mdash;Sitter
      for the Yellow Ajah in Tar Valon.  She looks more like a
      &ldquo;pretty boy&rdquo; than a reputable Yellow.  She grew up in
      Cairhien.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aludra">Aludra</A>, p.
      330&mdash;Illuminator from Tarabon with dark, waist-length hair, large dark
      eyes, and a plump mouth.  She was involved with the fireworks display
      for <A Href="#Galldrian">King Galldrian</A> of Cairhien that went awry
      when Trollocs came.  She was blamed for its failure, although she
      believed one of her colleagues, Tammuz, was to blame.  She was cast out
      of the Illuminators' Guild, and when she refused to stop practicing the
      art of making fireworks, several men tried to kill her.  She was saved
      by <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A> and <A Href="#Thom">Thom</A> in a barn, and as
      a sign of gratitude she gave Mat a roll of fireworks.  She is now in
      Ebou Dar, and asked Mat to find her a bellfounder.  <I>Note:  it is
      widely speculated that Aludra is looking for a bellfounder for a
      specific reason:  she wants to build a cannon.</I>
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Egwene">al'Vere, Egwene</A>, p.
      25&mdash;A young woman from Emond's Field, now raised to the
      <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A> among the Aes Sedai opposing
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>.  She has considerable strength with the
      One Power, and will most likely be one of the strongest Aes Sedai in
      over a thousand years.  She is also the first Dreamer in the Tower in
      almost 500 years; she trained with the Wise Ones to learn more of this
      Talent.  Egwene is good friends with <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne
      Trakand</A>, the Daughter-Heir of Andor, and is also a childhood friend
      of <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon
      Reborn</A>.  In fact, Rand and Egwene were all but Promised in their
      youth, but both of them feel an almost sibling-like love for each other
      now; they know that they cannot get married, and do not really want to.
      Egwene is the love object of both of Elayne's brothers,
      <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A> and <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>&mdash;she is
      flattered by Galad's attentions, but she does not return them; she does
      find Gawyn to her liking, and had a dream of bonding him as her Warder;
      she knows it will occur.  Egwene was most likely chosen Amyrlin because
      the Aes Sedai thought she could be guided by them without too much
      trouble; if this was their intent, they made a grave mistake, for Egwene
      shows promise to be one of the strongest Amyrlins in history.  Egwene
      has recently enlisted <A Href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</A> as the
      commander of her army to invade Tar Valon and remove Elaida from power.
      She has also opened the novice books to all interested women for the
      first time in history&mdash;in the past, they were only open to girls of a
      certain age, for fear that older women would not be able to handle the
      discipline.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>;
      <A Href="#Gawyn">Trakand, Gawyn</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alwhin">Alwhin</A>, p.
      412&mdash;Voice of the Blood, in service of <A Href="#Suroth">High Lady
      Suroth</A>.  She is a glowering woman.  Originally a <I>sul'dam</I>, she
      was intended to be the Leash Holder for <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>
      when she and <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> were given to Suroth by
      <A Href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</A>.  She was later promoted to a Voice of
      the Blood, the first <I>sul'dam</I> to ascend to the Blood.  However, it
      was thought unwise to leave her as a simple <I>sul'dam</I>; she found
      <A Href="#Renna">Renna</A> and <A Href="#Seta">Seta</A>, collared and
      helpless, and brought them to Suroth.  Suroth hid them for the good of
      the Empire, and promoted Alwhin to a Voice of the Blood.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Guaire">Amalasan, Guaire</A>,
      p. 477&mdash;False Dragon of centuries past, from Free Years 939-943.  He
      started the War of the Second Dragon and conquered much of the world
      between the Aiel Waste and the Aryth Ocean before a young king named
      <A Href="#Hawkwing">Artur Paendrag Tanreall</A> rose to overwhelming
      prominence and power.  Six Aes Sedai once attempted to capture him by
      themselves&mdash;he killed one of them and stilled two more.  It took a full
      circle of thirteen to finally capture him, and during his trial his
      followers beseiged Tar Valon and tried to free him, getting as far as
      the White Tower itself before being turned back.  His seige of Far
      Madding lasted only three weeks, and ended savagely.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon, The</A>; <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>, p. 74&mdash;The leader of
      the Aes Sedai, their equivalent of a King or Queen.  She in theory holds
      supreme power amongst the sisters, and leads the Hall of the Tower at
      its meetings.  Kings and queens of nations strong and weak will come if
      summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their entire trip figuring
      out how they will put a knife in her back while there.  The Seat is
      traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in her
      character.  The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must the
      vote to depose one.  Once chosen the Amyrlin is said to be &quot;of all
      Ajahs and none&quot;&mdash;all previous affiliations with Ajah are ignored
      (at least in theory).  The Ajahs have gotten fairly equal numbers of
      Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions:  no Amyrlin has
      been raised from the Red Ajah since Bonwhin Meraighdin, who
      was deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in
      <A Href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</A>'s day, except for
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</A>, the current Amyrlin
      Seat in Tar Valon; the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of
      Amyrlins from its Ajah&mdash;four of the last the last five Amyrlins (before
      Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah.  These two exceptions to the
      mean number of Amyrlins from one's Ajah have only added to the friction
      between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years.  The Amyrlin has a
      secretary of sorts, the <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A>,
      who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the Amyrlin was
      raised from.  The office was held by <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>,
      raised from the Blue Ajah, until she was deposed for her involvement
      with events surrounding the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  Her
      successor was the leader of the coup, <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida
      a'Roihan</A>, raised from the Red Ajah.  Siuan's deposition divided the
      Tower, and the faction opposing Elaida raised a new Amyrlin who could
      not be accused of choosing sides on the day Siuan was deposed:
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A>, who was outside the Tower and not
      even a full sister from the time Siuan was deposed to the time Egwene
      was Raised.  <I>See also</I>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Amys">Amys</A>, p. 47&mdash;Wise One
      of the Nine Valleys sept of the Taarad Aiel.
      <A Href="#Rhuarc">Rhuarc</A>'s wife (one of two).  She is one of the
      Wise Ones that trained <A Href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</A> and
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>.  She can channel, but still has prematurely
      white hair.  She is also a Dreamwalker.  <I>See also</I>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Jasfer">Anan, Jasfer</A>, p.
      555&mdash;<A Href="#Setalle">Setalle</A>'s husband.  He is a sea trader.
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Anan">Anan, Setalle</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Sashalle">Anderly, Sashalle</A>, p.
      310&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Red Ajah.  She was stilled by
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> during the battle at Dumai's Wells.  She has
      since been Healed by <A Href="#Flinn">Damer Flinn</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Nalesean">Andiaya, Nalesean</A>, p. 382&mdash;Late
      subcommander in the Band of the Red Hand.  He was a blocky man, taller
      than <A Href="#Talmanes">Talmanes</A> or <A Href="#Daerid">Daerid</A>.
      He led the other half of the Band of the Red Hand's cavalry, the part
      Talmanes did not command.  He kept a pointed black beard.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Andscale">Andscale</A>, p.
      504&mdash;One of the two most prominent bankers in Caemlyn.  She agreed
      to lend <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> 20,000 gold crowns when he was
      informed that alum had been discovered on Elayne's estates.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aram">Aram</A>, p. 93&mdash;Former Tuatha'an who gave
      up the Way of the Leaf to learn the sword when the Trollocs killed his
      mother.  He learned from <A Href="#Tam">Tam al'Thor</A>,
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s father and a Blademaster, and picked it up
      extremely fast.  He now serves as <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A>'s
      personal bodyguard.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Arangar">Aran'gar</A>, p.
      314&mdash;Name given to the reincarnation of
      <A Href="#Balthamel">Balthamel</A>.  Aran'gar was the right-hand dagger
      in a form of dueling popular right after the creation of the Bore.  The
      sport fell from common practice, since almost invariably both duelists
      died from the slow poison on the daggers.  The other Forsaken consider
      Balthamel's new body a fine joke; the soul of Balthamel now occupies the
      body of a beautiful young woman.  She still channels <I>saidin</I>, and
      now serves as <A Href="#Delana">Delana</A>'s maid.  Delana does not know
      that she is one of the Chosen reincarned, just that she stands far above
      her among the Darkfriends.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Balthamel">Balthamel</A>; <A Href="#Delana">Mosaline,
      Delana</A>; <A Href="#Osangar">Osan'gar</A>; <A Href="#Halima">Saranov,
      Halima</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Arganda">Arganda, Gerard</A>, p.
      99&mdash;Short-statured First Captain of <A Href="#Alliandre">Queen
      Alliandre</A>'s guards.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Chilares">Arman, Chilares</A>, p.
      266&mdash;Doe-eyed Kinswoman from Murandy.  She sells rugs.  She sat on the
      Knitting Circle before the Kin were disrupted by the Seanchan invasion.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Elaida">a'Roihan, Elaida do Avriny</A>, p.
      22&mdash;Aes Sedai formerly of the Red Ajah, now raised to the
      <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A> in Tar Valon.  She was born the
      youngest daughter of a minor House in the north of Murandy.  As a result
      of a Foretelling she had concerning the importance of the Royal Family
      of Andor in Tarmon Gaidon, she served as advisor to
      <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A> of Andor for her entire reign, and
      led the coup that deposed <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> and placed
      her on the Amyrlin Seat in Siuan's place.  She distrusts anyone not of
      her Ajah (as most Reds do), and doesn't believe she will ever trust any
      member of the Blue Ajah again, even in the slightest.  Her
      <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A> is
      <A Href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</A> of the White Ajah&mdash;she was all
      but forced to choose Alviarin due to her role in the deposition of
      Siuan.  If she chose a Keeper from her Ajah, she most likely would not
      have won the support of the White Ajah, and then <I>she</I> would have
      been stilled and banished from the Tower instead of Siuan.  She
      sometimes has the Foretelling, but not all that often or that
      strongly.  One of her Foretellings was that the Royal Family of Andor
      would play a crucial role in the Last Battle&mdash;this Foretelling occurred
      around the time the Succession was going on, so she immediately attached
      herself to Morgase as soon as it became clear that she would be the one
      to take the Lion Throne.  Another was to predict that
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> would shake the world on its very
      foundations&mdash;she constantly kicks herself for not doing something about
      him when he was in front of her, little more than a farmboy at the time.
      Her most recent Foretelling was that &quot;the White Tower would be
      whole again, except for remnants cast out and scorned, whole and
      stronger than ever.  <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> will face the
      Amyrlin Seat and know her anger.  The Black Tower will be rent in blood
      and fire, and sisters will walk its grounds.&quot;  The Foretelling
      about Rand is obviously deadly accurate.  However, the one about the
      Royal Family occurred at an inopportune time; at the time of Elaida's
      Foretelling, the Royal Family was not certain.  It may have meant
      Morgase, <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>, <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A>, and
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> (they have all had a large role to play in
      the recent past), but it is also possible it could have meant the old
      Royal Family, that of <A Href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</A>,
      <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail</A>, Galad, and later Elayne and Gawyn as
      well.  After all, Morgase is just Morgase, but Tigraine is the mother of
      the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  Her most recent Foretelling
      will of course be fulfilled, but not necessarily how she wants it to be;
      she does not realize that the Amyrlin Seat in the Foretelling might not
      be her, that the remnants cast out might be those loyal to her, and that
      the destruction of the Black Tower might have nothing to do with her.
      Elaida is quite strong in the One Power; only Siuan,
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>, <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>,
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>, <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>, and a few
      others could match her strength.  Elaida has always sought positions of
      power; she chose to follow Morgase to have a better chance at guiding
      the forces in the Last Battle, and tried to capture Rand al'Thor in an
      effort to gain similar control.  The only sisters that support her are
      those that are actually Black Ajah and those that would follow any
      Amyrlin legally raised, as Elaida was (although just barely; all laws
      used to raise her were stretched almost to their breaking point, and
      some believe they actually did shatter).  Elaida is currently building
      a palace for herself atop the Warders' old practice yard.  The building
      will be about as tall as the White Tower.  <I>See also</I>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Einion">Avharin, Einion</A>, p.
      466&mdash;Important woman in Far Madding's history.  Her statue points to
      the Caemlyn Gate.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aviendha">Aviendha</A>, p.
      44&mdash;Aiel of the Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel.  Formerly a
      Maiden of the Spear, she was forced to give up the spear to become a
      Wise One because she had the ability to channel inborn.  She has green
      eyes, and is of age with <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> and
      <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>.  She is more than pretty with dark, reddish
      hair.  Aviendha is one of the three women in <A Href="#Min">Min</A>'s
      viewing of Rand&mdash;she also saw that she was to fall in love with him when
      she went through the three rings in Rhuidean.  She denied her feelings
      for him at first, but when the wagons crossed the Dragonwall toward
      Cairhien, sweat tents became unavailable and she tried bathing as
      &quot;wetlanders&quot; did; Rand came in as she was standing before the
      bath in her skin, and she panicked.  She created a Traveling gateway to
      Seanchan (she does not remember how), trying to get as far away from
      Rand as possible, into the middle of winter.  When Rand rescued her, she
      decided she could not hide her feelings any longer, and the two ended up
      spending the night in each other's arms before coming back.  Aviendha
      says a similar incident will not occur, and punishes any Maiden who
      makes a crack about it (how they found out about something that occurred
      on the far side of the world on another continent is a different subject
      entirely).  She felt <I>toh</I> toward <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> for
      violating her trust, but upon hearing that Elayne would consent to being
      her sister-wife, Aviendha felt empowered to show her feelings for Rand
      once again.  She is not certain what she thinks of a <I>second</I>
      sister-wife in Min, but she is determined to meet her before passing any
      judgement.  She has recently been having trouble learning Traveling
      again; the way Elayne forms the weave is different from how she used it
      to get to Seanchan, and it is difficult to learn something once you
      already learned it another way.  She has, however, mastered the art of
      untying weaves&mdash;a feat which was thought impossible by all Aes Sedai,
      as well as the Forsaken.  She and Elayne have plans to adopt eachother
      as first-sisters.  <I>See also</I>

      p. 90&mdash;A young woman from Saldaea with long dark hair and dark eyes.
      She is the daughter of <A Href="#Bashere">Davram</A> and
      <A Href="#Deira">Deira</A> Bashere, and their oldest surviving
      offspring.  Her two older brothers were killed, and when Davram sent her
      younger brother off to fight while keeping her at home, she ran away and
      swore the oath of a Hunter of the Horn in Illian.  When she became a
      Hunter, she renounced her old name, Zarine, at first considering
      adopting the name &quot;Mandarb&quot;&mdash;she chose Faile when she found
      that <A Href="#Mandarb">Mandarb</A> was the name of
      <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>'s horse.  She fell in love with
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A> while on her search for the Horn,
      who told her that the Horn had been found.  She was shocked, but even
      more so to find out that <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> was the
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> and that both he and Perrin are
      <I>ta'veren</I>.  Faile stayed near Perrin, and finally accompanied him
      to the Two Rivers where she helped fend off the Trolloc attacks; the two
      were married shortly afterwards.  They were then proclaimed Lord and
      Lady of the Two Rivers.  Perrin hated the idea, but Faile insisted they
      have a modest estate, and even servants, which she trained herself.  Her
      name means &quot;falcon&quot; in the Old Tongue; she is the falcon in
      <A Href="#Min">Min</A>'s viewings of Perrin.  She is very protective of
      her blacksmith, and does whatever she can to make sure he not so much as
      <I>looks</I> at another woman, even though he has no intention of doing
      so.  She is a very jealous wife, especially toward people like
      <A Href="#Berelain">Berelain</A> who eye her husband all the time.  She
      even cornered <A Href="#Min">Min</A> when they first came to Caemlyn and
      Perrin greeted her warmly to make sure Min had no intentions toward him.
      She left with Perrin to Ghealdan to find <A Href="#Masema">Masema</A>,
      and while he was away her party was ambushed by the Shaido Aiel and she

      31&mdash;Former First Prince of the Sword and Captain of the Queen's Guards
      under <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A> in Andor.  He was appointed
      to the position because Morgase had no living male relatives, but was
      exiled from Caemlyn on a suggestion from Morgase's new advisor,
      <A Href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</A>.  He moved to his private estates
      in rural Andor, where he presided over the trial of three young women
      who unintentionally burned a barn: they turned out to be
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>, the former <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin
      Seat</A>; <A Href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</A>, the former
      <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A>, and
      <A Href="#Min">Min Farshaw</A>.  When these three made an oath to serve
      him and then apparently broke it, he followed them out of sheer
      curiosity to Salidar.  Once there, he discovered the true identity of
      the three, as well as that the Tower was truly broken.  The Aes Sedai in
      Salidar persuaded him to command the army they would need to take the
      Amyrlin Seat from <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>, since he was the only
      commander that the Warders thought would be willing and able to help
      them.  He is one of the six best military commanders west of the Aiel

      <A Href="#Rodel">Rodel Ituralde</A>, <A Href="#Bashere">Davram
      Bashere</A>, <A Href="#Agelmar">Agelmar Jagad</A>, and
      <A Href="#Mat">Matrim Cauthon</A>.  Although neither of them would admit
      it, Bryne seems to be developing feelings for Siuan Sanche; he wishes to
      avoid another mistake like his relationship as
      <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A>'s lover, and also never forgave Siuan for
      when she publicly shamed him years ago.  She seems to be developing
      similar feelings for him, much to her dismay.  He plans to be the first
      ever general to take the city of Tar Valon; the closest anyone else ever
      came was with <A Href="#Guaire">Guaire Amalasan</A>'s armies, who got as
      far as the White Tower itself, and <A Href="#Hawkwing">Artur
      Hawkwing</A>, who never managed to go beyond beseiging the city.
      Actually, Amalasan's troops never beseiged the city, they simply managed
      to breech the walls; Hawkwing never managed to stop the supply ships
      coming up the river.  Bryne believes he will be able to overcome this
      problem.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Dark">Dark One</A>, p. 15&mdash;Name
      used in every land for Shai'tan, the source of all evil, complete
      antithesis of <A Href="#Creator">The Creator</A> in every way.  At the
      moment of Creation, Shai'tan was imprisoned by the Creator at Shayol
      Ghul.  This prison kept him from touching the world until it was bored
      into by Aes Sedai during the Age of Legends.  This hole, called the
      Bore, allowed the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new
      outbreaks of war, treachery, violence, and crime.  The attempt to free
      the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the
      War of Power by some, especially those on the Shadow's side), during
      which a number of important leaders forsook the Light and gave their
      lives to the Dark One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and
      were 13 of the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  The War
      of the Shadow did not end until <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A>,
      the <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>, and his Hundred Companions Traveled to
      Shayol Ghul and re-sealed the Dark One back into his prison, trapping
      the Forsaken with him.  At the moment of sealing, Shai'tan lashed out at
      those sealing the prison, driving them insane and tainting <I>saidin</I>
      itself, the male half of the True Source, dooming all male Aes Sedai to
      madness as well and starting the Time of Madness.  These seals are
      weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the Dark One is
      once again able to exert influence on the world.  These seals were
      scattered throughout the world by Aes Sedai during the Breaking of the
      World.  In order of when they were found, they were placed:  1) At the
      Eye of the World (broken when it was found); 2) in the hands of
      <A Href="#Domon">Bayle Domon</A>, later pilfered by
      <A Href="#Turak">High Lord Turak</A> of the Seanchan (broken at the
      battle of Falme), 3) On Seanchan, part of High Lord Turak's collection
      (broken at the battle at Falme); 4) In the Great Hold at the Stone of
      Tear (still intact); 5) In the Panarch's Palace in Tanchico (broken
      enroute to Salidar); 6) One in Rhuidean (still intact), and 7) Found by
      <A Href="#Taim">Mazrim Taim</A> on a small farm in Saldaea (still
      intact).  Despite being made of <I>cuendillar</I>, the three that remain
      unbroken can be cut with a knife and would break by a fall from a table.
      The Dark One is also referred to by other euphemisms, including
      Sightblinder, Lord of the Grave, Father of Lies, Grassburner,
      Leafblighter, Heartsbane, Soulsbane, Lord of the Twilight, Father of
      Storms, Shepherd of the Night, Soulblinder, and (among Darkfriends) the

      the first day proceeded to almost equal Lews Therin's accomplishments,
      almost equal Lews Therin's strength, and almost equal him but never
      surpass him in everything.  He became one of the Light's greatest
      generals, once again second in command under Lews Therin.  Demandred
      believed that he was Lews Therin's intellectual and military superior,
      and was furious when Lews Therin was chosen to lead the Light's forces
      over him during the War of the Shadow.  He developed a burning hatred of
      Lews Therin, and finally dedicated his life to the Shadow so he could
      finally better Lews Therin&mdash;he believed the Shadow would eventually win
      the war since Lews Therin was commanding the Light's armies, and that if
      he, Barid Bel Medar, had been chosen to command them, the Light would
      have prevailed.  When Demandred was freed from the Bore, he transferred
      his hatred of Lews Therin intact to the new recipient of his soul,
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>.  Demandred was recently told by the
      <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A> to lead his plan to convert or destroy Rand,
      and promised him to be <A Href="#Naeblis">Nae'blis</A> if he succeeded.
      However, since <A Href="#Moridin">Moridin</A> has been declared

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Min">Farshaw, Elmindreda (Min)</A>, p. 73&mdash;Young
      woman from Baerlon.  She has a special ability that few besides herself
      know about:  she sees images and auras around people, especially around
      Aes Sedai and Warders, that foretell their futures.  Min does not always
      know what these viewings mean, but when she does, it <I>will</I> happen;
      it is only a question of how and when.  Min was fascinated by the number
      of images she saw around <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>, especially the one
      she saw that included herself:  he is destined to fall in love with
      three different women, one of which is herself.  She usually dresses in
      attire reserved for men; this habit was picked up when growing up with
      her father, who was a miner.  However, once she started to develop
      feelings for Rand, she began to wear more traditionally feminine attire.
      Min was in Tar Valon helping <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A> with her
      viewings' information when Siuan was deposed, and it was Min that freed
      Siuan and <A Href="#Leane">Leane</A> from the dungeon.  She accompanied
      the two former leaders of the Aes Sedai to Salidar; once there, she left
      for Caemlyn with Salidar's embassy to Rand.  Once in Caemlyn, she
      brought information to Rand about the embassy there, and its intentions.
      She has only had one viewing that ever failed, which concerned
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>; since Moiraine is believed dead, she
      hopes that her viewings might be wrong at least once in a while.  Min is
      one of two women that can rightfully call herself a lover to the

      the late <A Href="#Fel">Herid Fel</A>, a philosopher who worked in

      until he took a Murandian lance in the thigh, and ever since has desired
      to help people with injuries.  He came for the amnesty to see if he
      could learn to Heal; as it turns out, he is very Talented, and has
      developed methods of Healing that have been forgotten since the Age of
      Legends.  He managed to partially Heal <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s wound
      in his side, to separate it from the rest of his body so the evil does
      not seep into it anymore.  Since he was placed on
      <A Href="#Taim">Taim</A>'s Traitors' List, he has been in hiding&mdash;he did
      not assist in the attack on <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>, but Rand thinks it

      Typical of most Whites, she has a very cool, collected personality.
      She serves as <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the

      to choose Alviarin in order to gain the support of the White Ajah when
      bringing charges against <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A>; unknown to
      Elaida, this also brought her the support of the Black Ajah.  Without
      Alviarin as Keeper, the White Ajah would most likely have been divided
      over whether to depose Siuan, and only the Red would be behind Elaida,
      which would most likely have led to the stilling of Elaida and possibly
      even the dismantling of the Red Ajah.  It still may, since Elaida is
      rapidly losing her power to Alviarin&mdash;and if Alviarin's loyalties are
      ever revealed, nothing will save either of them.  Alviarin has been

      and upon <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A>'s return, he gave her her
      kingdom in one piece, as it was when she left.  Allegedly, she was so
      happy that he had done this that she made Gaebril her new advisor.
      However, during <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>'s trip through Caemlyn to deliver
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>'s letter, Mat overheard Gaebril ordering
      someone to kill Elayne and anyone else with her&mdash;he tried to find a way
      to report this information to Morgase, but ended up telling Elayne.
      Gaebril was discovered to be <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A>, one
      of the Forsaken, who has a preference to having pretty women around him.
      His &quot;pretty woman&quot; was Morgase, and he planned to wrest
      control of Andor from her.  Morgase realized he was controlling her and
      left the country so quickly a rumor sprang up that she had been killed;
      when Caemlyn was taken by <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> and Rahvin killed,

      the Shadow, she became the leading authority on diseases of the brain,
      and spent much of her life dealing with the insane, schizophrenic, and
      others well beyond the touch of Healing.  She was the best at subtle
      manipulations of the human mind that ever lived.  After the Bore was
      drilled, she went through a change as she realized the world could never
      live up to her standards.  So she began dressing in the very way she
      once mocked, with low cut dresses that clung to her and left little to
      the imagination.  After being released from the Bore, Graendal took up
      residence in Arad Doman, capturing several members of the Royal Family
      to use as servants.  All of her servants are not only physically
      well-shaped and good-looking, but also had power in their society before
      she captured them.  She includes in her collection the sister of the
      Domani king, two rulers from Shara, and other important figures.  She

      Ocean under his son, <A Href="#Luthair">Luthair Paendrag
      Mondwhin</A>, in hopes of conquering new lands there.  All contact with
      these armies ended with Hawkwing's death, which set off the War of the
      Hundred Years.  The descendants of the armies under Luthair have now
      returned to reclaim the lands of Hawkwing's empire in the Old
      World&mdash;they now call themselves the Seanchan.  Artur Hawkwing's real

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Ishamael">Ishamael</A>, p. 637&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  He was the most powerful of the Forsaken, and during the Age
      of Legends he was a prominent philosopher and theologian named Elan
      Morin Tedronai.  He was never really bound inside the Bore, and led the
      hidden forces of the Shadow for the three thousand odd years from the
      end of the War of the Shadow to the present.  He took credit for such
      things as convincing the then insane <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin
      Telamon</A> to kill everyone he loved, pursuading the dying
      <A Href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</A> not to accept the Aes Sedai
      Healing that might have saved his life, sending the Trollocs out of the
      Great Blight during the Trolloc Wars, and many other events in history
      that turned out poorly.  When the rest of the Forsaken were freed,
      Ishamael kept them away from eachother's throats.  He confronted
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> at the Eye of the World where he was severed
      from the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>'s bonds; he confronted him again
      at Falme where Rand put his sword through him and melted it, but not
      after Ishamael gave Rand a wound that he has not been able to recover
      from yet; and he confronted Rand in the Stone of Tear after he took
      <I>Callandor</I>.  Rand killed Ishamael after beating him sore by
      plunging <I>Callandor</I> into his heart.  His body rotted quickly, but
      it was proof that Ba'alzamon, which he called himself
      to the public, was a human being, and not the <A Href="#Dark">Dark
      One</A>.  However, death is not always final with the Dark One; with the
      appearance of two other Foraken presumed dead, it is likely that
      Ishamael has been resurrected as well.  <I>See also</I>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Lanfear">Lanfear</A>, p.
      318&mdash;One of the Forsaken.  Unlike the rest of the Forsaken, she chose
      her name for herself, which means &quot;Daughter of the Night&quot; in
      the Old Tongue.  She was born <A Href="#Mierin">Mierin Eronaile</A>, and
      was very strong in the One Power.  She worked at the Collam Daan, the
      primary facility for research into the One Power.  Her final discovery
      there was what she thought was a new source for the One Power, one that
      could be harnessed by men and women alike&mdash;this source turned out to be
      the emissions through a thin spot in the Pattern from the
      <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>'s prison.  She and another Aes Sedai named
      Beidomon bored into the prison, creating what is now referred to as
      simply the Bore, allowing the Dark One to touch the world again and
      leading to the War of the Shadow.  Around this time, Mierin formed a
      relationship with <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A>, who headed
      the forces of the Light against the Shadow and was the most powerful man
      she had found.  Lews Therin broke off the relationship when he found
      that she only wanted him for his power and authority and the possibility
      of power for herself through him.  Mierin never let go of him, and when
      he later met and married <A Href="#Ilyena">Ilyena Moerelle</A>, she
      tried to disrupt the wedding ceremony as well as split the two apart by
      any means.  Eventually she went to Shayol Ghul to dedicate her soul to
      the Shadow, most likely to finally get back at Lews Therin for leaving
      her.  She declared as her territory the World of Dreams,
      <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>, using it to ends now unknown.  She transferred
      her obsessive love intact to Lews Therin's soul's new body,
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, after being freed from the Bore.  She
      first appeared to him as a young woman named Selene, but disguised her
      appearance as a slightly less beautiful (but still stunning) woman.
      Almost a year later, Lanfear found that Rand had been
      &quot;unfaithful&quot; to her, and she tried to kill him.  Before she
      could, she was pushed through the twisted stone doorway
      <I>ter'angreal</I> leading to the lands of the Eelfinn by
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>, becoming trapped.  Lanfear has since

      <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A> back into his prison.  Unfortunately,
      during this stroke he was driven insane by the Dark One's touch,
      eventually killing his wife <A Href="#Ilyena">Ilyena</A>, his children,
      and everyone he loved, as well as anyone who carried a drop of his
      blood.  For this act, people remember him with a new name:

      <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A> gave him his sanity back long enough
      for him to realize what he had done; Lews Therin killed himself by
      drawing on <I>saidin</I> too heavily, causing a mountain to form on the
      spot where he stood.  This mountain is called Dragonmount, and is near
      the present-day city of Tar Valon.  It is unfortunate that the name of
      one of the greatest men to ever live is now synonymous with evil, for
      Lews Therin killed his family due to the Dark One's influence, but
      without Lews Therin there may not have been a world left in which to
      kill them.  Lews Therin's voice often speaks inside
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s head, offering advice or sobbing over lost
      women or ranting about killing men who can channel.  It even tries to
      seize control of <I>saidin</I> sometimes, much to Rand's fear&mdash;Rand is
      certain that Lews Therin cannot take control of <I>saidin</I> away from
      him if he seizes it first, but he is almost as certain that if Lews
      Therin seizes it first, he will not be able to snatch it back.

      very emotional&mdash;in fact, he has emotional walls all around him that he
      has been building for years.  His country, Malkier, was overrun by
      Trollocs shortly after he was born, and is now corrupted by the Great
      Blight.  Lan, the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a one-man
      war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight.  He fought
      Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status.  He was
      eventually bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at least
      changed its style).  When Lan and Moiraine brought

      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A>, <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>, and

      found that there was something which could throw his guard down, but he
      was the last to notice it:  affection for Nynaeve.  As Moiraine put it,
      Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan's emotional walls and break them
      down without him even knowing they were there.  The two of them are now
      married.  Upon Moiraine's death, Lan's bond was immediately transferred
      to <A Href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</A> until Nynaeve is ready to have his
      bond transferred to her.  Myrelle tried to keep Lan's status secret, but
      she was given away when she tried to buy one of Lan's favorite foods,
      coin peppers, too far south (they are very popular in Shienar, and were
      in Malkier before it fell to the Blight, but do not grow well in
      southern climates).  Upon learning of where Lan was,
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> sent him to Ebou Dar to serve as a Warder

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Nynaeve">Mandragoran, el'Nynaeve ti al'Meara</A>,
      p. 25&mdash;Young woman from Emond's Field, now an Aes Sedai of the Yellow
      Ajah.  She was the Wisdom of her village, the youngest such ever chosen
      in Emond's Field.  She left when four of her villagers were taken away
      from the Two Rivers by <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> and
      <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>.  While the group traveled away from her home and
      toward her new life, Nynaeve made several discoveries:  she could
      channel the One Power, and had already done so without really knowing
      what she was doing; she developed feelings for Lan Mandragoran,
      Moiraine's Warder and the uncrowned king of the now dead nation Malkier;
      and she has a major role to play, as all of her younger friends in the
      group do, in the years to come.  She is very strong in the One Power;
      only a select few who were alive during the Age of Legends could match
      her as well as a few young women still being trained.  When she arrived
      in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a novice,
      despite not being able to even <I>sense</I> the True Source unless
      angry, a result of her having to learn some minimal control of her
      ability without teaching.  She was sent on a false mission by
      <A Href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</A> on which she was almost leashed by the
      Seanchan as <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> was.  After she returned to the
      Tower, <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> sent her on a mission to hunt
      down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in
      Tanchico, she encountered <A Href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</A> and managed
      to better her in a duel of the Power.  Moghedien escaped, but two
      encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her,
      leashing her with an <I>a'dam</I> in <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>.  Nynaeve
      took Moghedien with her to seek out <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> and
      <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A> while they were fighting each other, and at
      the last moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin
      to ash with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could
      draw to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain
      control of himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire.  Nynaeve then kept
      Moghedien under control with a modified <I>a'dam</I> in Salidar.
      Nynaeve wished to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she
      thinks the Tower meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and
      wants no part of it.  She is determined to Heal anything short of death,
      and has already managed to Heal gentling.  Nynaeve felt bad when
      Moiraine died, because her first thought was not of her, but that now
      Lan was free from their bond.  She was not told that Lan's bond had been
      passed to <A Href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</A> the moment of Moiraine's death.
      She and Lan are now married, and the plan is for Lan's bond to pass to
      her as soon as she and Myrelle can get together.  As Lan's wife, she
      will become the Queen of Malkier when and if Lan raises the Golden Crane
      and frees Malkier from the Blight.  She now wears the <I>ki'sain</I>, an
      ornament traditionally worn by Malkieri wives, consisting of a dot on
      the forehead between the eyes&mdash;Lan did not tell her of this tradition,
      but when she found out she immediately took it up.  It is the one
      element of her appearance that never fades for one second when every
      other part changes faster than the eye can follow in

      <A Href="#Gaebril">Gaebril</A> had the guards swear new oaths to the
      laws and customs of Andor (instead of to the Queen), Tallanvor swore
      them but immediately went back to his room and reswore the old oath in
      the old style (cutting his arm with his sword, indicating that his blood
      will be shed before the Queen's will).  He loves his queen more than his
      life, and now serves as her personal bodyguard.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Hu">Marwin, Hu</A>, p. 105&mdash;Young man from

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Masema">Masema Dagar</A>, p.
      89&mdash;The <A Href="#Prophet">Prophet</A>.  He was once one of
      <A Href="#Uno">Uno</A>'s underlings, and the one who respected
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> the least, but after he found out that Rand was
      the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>, he went his own way, preaching
      of Rand's glory as the &quot;Lord Dragon Reborn.&quot;  Rand has since
      dispatched <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A> to bring Masema back into line.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Masuri">Masuri Sokawa</A>, p.
      92&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Brown Ajah.  She grew up in Arafel, and was part
      of Salidar's embassy to <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>.  She is now sworn to
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>, and travels with <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A>
      and company.  She is taller than <A Href="#Seonid">Seonid</A> by a hand.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Ethenielle">Materasu, Ethenielle Kirukon</A>, p.
      521&mdash;Holder of the Throne of the Clouds of Kandor&mdash;that is, the Queen of
      Kandor.  She is plump, and has gray-streaked black hair.  She is about
      half a hand taller than <A Href="#Merilille">Merilille</A>.  She has
      blue eyes.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Mat">Matrim (Mat) Cauthon</A>, p. 29&mdash;Young man
      from Emond's Field.  He is <I>ta'veren</I>.  Along with his good
      friends, <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> and <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin
      Aybara</A>, he left home to escape the Trolloc attacks after
      Winternight.  On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger from Shadar
      Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which he carried
      with him for a long time.  He was separated from the dagger by Aes Sedai
      Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory sequence.  These
      gaps were filled and more when he passed through the twisted door to the
      land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three requests:  a foxhead
      medallion that protects him from women's channeling, a way out of the
      land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes that were the
      gaps in his memory.  Mat's <I>ta'veren</I> qualities manifest themselves
      particularly well with random events, such as dice games&mdash;he almost
      never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are weighted.  He has
      found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling, and along with his
      newfound memories he can win almost every battle he fights quite
      decisively.  He has four sisters, including <A Href="#Eldrin">Eldrin</A>
      and <A Href="#Bode">Bodewhin</A>, who are 17 and 16, respectively.  His
      father <A Href="#Abell">Abell</A> is one of the best archers in the Two
      Rivers, possibly in the World.  Mat has gotten in the habit of carrying
      concealed knives under his clothes in case he is attacked&mdash;his
      collection would surprise anyone.  In the Waste, he met a woman named
      Melindhra, a Maiden of the Spear from the Shaido Clan.  However, she is
      not the <A Href="#9Moons">Daughter of the Nine Moons</A>, who Mat is
      destined to marry according to the Aelfinn; besides, she tried to kill
      him on orders from her master among the Darkfriends.  Mat had to kill
      her to save his own skin, but regrets it deeply.  He also has a scar
      along his neck from where the Eelfinn tried to kill him&mdash;which was also
      in accordance with what the Aelfinn told him, that he is &quot;to die
      and live again.&quot;  He currently leads an army called the Band of the
      Red Hand, after the army of <A Href="#Aemon">King Aemon</A> of old
      Manetheren, and serves in a way as Rand's personal general&mdash;this works
      well, since Mat seems to be a better general than even
      <A Href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</A>, who has earned his reputation as
      one of the best commanders alive.  Mat does not trust any Aes Sedai, and
      because of this refuses to take his foxhead medallion off even to take a
      bath.  Mat went to Ebou Dar to try to keep an eye on
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> and <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> and
      prevent them from getting themselves killed.  While there he was

      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A> asked her to resign her position after only

      escaped his captors, possibly with Black Ajah assistance (although this
      is totally unconfirmed).  Hearing of <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s amnesty,
      Taim came to Caemlyn and became the head of Rand's school of male
      channelers.  He is almost as strong in the One Power as Rand is.  Taim
      claims to have held off the madness that normally accompanies the taint
      for almost 35 years&mdash;he has been using the One Power for a very long
      time, and knows many tricks that Rand had not thought of on his own or
      been taught by <A Href="#Asmodean">Asmodean</A>, such as how to test men
      for the ability.  He seems to resent being second to Rand, and also gave
      the orders to kill Rand.  He is almost as tall as Rand, has a hooked
      nose and dark eyes.  He is a physically powerful and graceful man,
      although his skill with a sword is lacking.  <I>See also</I>

      Sedai of the Green Ajah with iron-gray hair.  She retired to a rose
      garden in northern Ghealdan, but has since left it due to the difficulty
      of growing decent roses with the weather the way it used to be.  She
      refused two appointments to the Hall of the Tower, when refusing even
      once is unheard of.  She also refused to become head of the Green Ajah.
      It is said that she has had more Warders than most sisters have had
      shoes.  She has more strength than anyone in a thousand years except
      perhaps for <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> and
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>.  Although a Green, she has confronted
      and captured more men that can channel than any other woman; unknown to
      most, the men she captures tend to live longer after being gentled than
      the average.  She is somewhat of a living legend among Aes Sedai.
      According to <A Href="#Min">Min</A>, Cadsuane will teach
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> and the Asha'man something&mdash;they will not like
      it, especially not from her, but they will have to learn it.  She is the

      him with it, and took the poisoned dagger from the third and killed him
      with it.  He is wiry, has a sharp face, and is coldhearted, though he
      smiles a lot.  He is fond of teasing women.  He claims to have been a
      merchant's guard, then a mercenary, then a Hunter for the Horn.  He is

      She spent her years teaching until the Bore was opened and she dedicated
      her life to the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>.  During the War of Power,
      she created &quot;schools&quot; for the children, at which she taught
      the children to spy on their parents and other such things.  After her

      a duel to the last, and Nynaeve managed to better Moghedien, much to the

      she ripped <A Href="#Birgitte">Birgitte</A>'s soul out of the World of

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Moiraine">Moiraine Damodred</A>, p. 311&mdash;Aes

      <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</A>'s youngest half-sister, and
      <A Href="#Laman">King Laman</A>'s niece.  She is considered short among
      her people, and the Cairhienin are already a short people.  When it was
      discovered that she had the ability to channel inborn, Moiraine went to
      Tar Valon to become an Aes Sedai.  Just before being raised to the
      shawl, she and her friend <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> witnessed
      Gitara Moroso's Foretelling of the Rebirth of the
      <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>.  Moiraine and Siuan walked away from each
      other and did not speak to each other again (at least in public), but
      both held secret communication with each other and dedicated their lives
      to finding and guiding the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.
      Moiraine found the young man she sought on Winternight in Emond's Field,
      a young man named <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, along with two more
      <I>ta'veren</I>, <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A> and
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A> and two women with the spark of the
      Power inborn, <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A> and
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</A>.  When Moiraine was shortly
      raised to the shawl, she met <A Href="#Lan">al'Lan Mandragoran</A>, the
      uncrowned King of Malkier, who was fighting alone against the Shadow in
      the Blight; she asked Lan to become her Warder, and he accepted.  She is
      very strong in the Power, stronger than almost all living Aes Sedai.  In
      the Stone of Tear, Moiraine confronted and killed the Forsaken
      <A Href="#Belal">Be'lal</A> with balefire, just before he would have
      killed Rand.  Later, after having an inkling of the future events from
      the testing <I>ter'angreal</I> for the Wise Ones, Moiraine managed to
      push the Forsaken <A Href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</A> through the twisted
      doorway <I>ter'angreal</I> into the land of the Eelfinn, trapping both
      her and Lanfear there.  It is unknown whether Moiraine lives on in the
      land off the Finn, or whether she is dead, but her bond with Lan has
      been severed, and other Aes Sedai consider her a legend, not only for
      discovering the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> but for killing or
      trapping two of the Forsaken as well.  Despite her efforts, and for the
      most part, success, <A Href="#Cadsuane">Cadsuane</A> still thinks she

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Morgase">Morgase Trakand</A>, p. 32&mdash;Former Queen
      of Andor and High Seat of House Trakand.  Mother of
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> and <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>.  She
      married <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</A>, a prince of
      Cairhien, to further solidify her claim to the Throne of Andor and keep
      peace between the two nations; when <A Href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</A>
      disappeared, Morgase made the best claim to succeed her, and married her
      widower to gain the support that would be gained by such action.
      Taringail was Elayne's and Gawyn's father; he died when they were young.
      Morgase has since gone through several lovers, including
      <A Href="#Thom">Thomdril Merrilin</A>, a former court-bard;
      <A Href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</A>, her First Prince of the Sword and
      Captain of the Guards; and most recently
      <A Href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</A>, a man who led the faction that
      stilled the riots in Caemlyn that sprang up on Morgase's trip to Tar
      Valon to inquire about Elayne's whereabouts.  Thom was exiled from the
      city of Caemlyn when he started telling her what he really thought of
      some of her plans, her relationship with Bryne ebbed away until finally
      Gaebril told her to exile him too, and Gaebril eventually chased Morgase
      herself out of the city when she found he was usurping her power.  The
      Daughter-Heir of Andor is traditionally trained by Aes Sedai in the
      White Tower, and Morgase underwent novice training to keep the tradition
      alive.  She was given the gift of a Great Serpent ring despite not being
      Accepted, and still wears it on her left hand.  She was previously
      advised by <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</A> of the Red
      Ajah, who is now the <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A> in Tar Valon.
      When Morgase discovered that Gaebril (who, unbeknownst to her, was
      actually <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A>) meant to usurp her throne, she
      left, and when she learned that the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>
      had taken over Caemlyn and none of her former supporters would give her
      aid, she fled to Amadicia to get help from the only place she thought
      she could: <A Href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</A> and the Children of the
      Light.  She is not aware that <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> only wanted to
      give her country back to her, not to mention believes that she is dead.
      If she made her presence known, she would no doubt have her country back
      in one piece and all would be well, but as royalty she believes she must
      work on her own and trust no one.  The entire world believes Morgase
      dead except for a select few.  She is currently in hiding, using her
      mother's name, <A Href="#Dorlain">Maighdin</A> to avoid instant
      recognition, and a prisoner of the Shaido.  Her sign is three golden
      keys.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Elaida">a'Roihan, Elaida do Avriny</A>;

      name means &quot;Death&quot; in the Old Tongue; no one deserves the name
      more.  He is fond of using the True Power, the power drawn directly from
      the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>; the <I>saa</I> have already appeared
      in his eyes, yet he still controls his use of the True Power (most
      thought it impossible to avoid drawing too much of it once the
      <I>saa</I> appeared).  Moridin is careful not to attempt to force the
      Pattern to behave how he wants it to&mdash;he knows that with someone as
      strongly <I>ta'veren</I> as <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>, that is all but
      impossible, not to mention foolish.  Instead, he attempts to keep
      everything in chaos (as per the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>'s
      command, &quot;Let the Lord of Chaos Rule&quot;), hoping that subtle
      manipulations will further his goals.  He has been declared
      <A Href="#Naeblis">Nae'blis</A>, the one to be second only to the
      Great Lord of the Dark after the Last Battle, and given control of the
      <I>cour'souvra</I> controlling the minds of

      She is the youngest daughter of a lesser House in Cairhien.  Many
      sisters consider her little better than a wilder.  She is now sworn to

      in the Two Rivers while scouting the Whitecloak camp.  She later found
      that bonding Rand was a grievious error; not only is it impossible to
      Compel him in comparison to most Warders (she compared it to attempting
      to uproot an oak tree with her bare hands), but she constantly feels the
      pain he experiences from the wound in his side, perhaps even more
      severely than he feels it.

      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A> was deposed, along with most of her Ajah.
      She was one of the six sisters who held much of the power in Salidar

      death, bringing her Warder count to four, at least until
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> is ready to have him as a Warder.  She

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Fain">Padan Fain</A>, p.
      316&mdash;Former peddler that frequently came to Emond's Field.  A
      Darkfriend, he was given orders to locate the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon
      Reborn</A> and narrowed it to three boys in Emond's Field.  While
      persuing them, he encountered the spirit of
      <A Href="#Mordeth">Mordeth</A> in Aridhol, now called Shadar Logoth.
      Mordeth attempted to consume Fain's soul, but instead the two souls
      merged, producing something more evil than either of them alone.  Fain
      no longer takes his orders from the Shadow; he has his own evil agenda.
      It is said, &quot;The look of the Eyeless is fear,&quot; from observing
      that a Myrddraal's look causes fear in the hearts of men.  Fain's look
      has that effect on Myrddraal&mdash;Fades feel the same fear of Fain as men
      feel from a Fade.  Fain is also called
      <A Href="#Ordeith">Ordeith</A>, a name he adopted to become a Whitecloak
      officer.  He is perhaps the most evil man alive.  He now served for a
      time as advisor to <A Href="#Toram">Toram Riatin</A>, one of the
      Cairhienin nobles in rebellion to <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>.  Rand has a
      bounty of 100,000 gold crowns on his head&mdash;Fain killed Rand's friends
      because they were his friends, he pillaged his homeland because
      it was his homeland, and Rand intends to see him dead for it.  In
      addition, <A Href="#Moridin">Moridin</A> is now hunting Fain, although
      indirectly&mdash;he sent <A Href="#Isam">Isam</A> (alias
      <A Href="#Slayer">Slayer</A>) to kill him.  <I>See also</I>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Berelain">Paeron, Berelain sur Paendrag</A>, p.
      98&mdash;The First of Mayene, their equivalent of a king or queen.
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> put her in charge of
      Cairhien along with <A Href="#Rhuarc">Rhuarc</A> until she left with
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A> and <A Href="#Faile">Faile</A> to find
      <A Href="#Masema">Masema</A>.  She is fond of wearing the latest
      fashion in dresses, and those are usually quite revealing.  She has her
      eyes on many men, but <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A> foremost&mdash;she is
      <A Href="#Min">Min</A>'s hawk in her viewings of Perrin.  She has black
      hair.  She is a very capable ruler, willing to do almost anything to
      preserve the welfare and independence of her people.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Paitar">Paitar Nachiman</A>,
      p. 521&mdash;King of Arafel, brother of <A Href="#Kiruna">Kiruna</A>.  His
      face is creased, though he was once stunningly handsome, and tall.  He
      wears his gray hair cut short.  He has a deep voice and broad shoulders.
      His favorite granddaughter is married to

      p. 79&mdash;Man who makes paddleboats at the Academy.

      Sedai captured at Dumai's Wells.  She asked to swear fealty to

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Abelle">Pendar, Abelle</A>, p. 31&mdash;Andoran noble,
      leader of a strong House that supported <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A>
      during the Succession.  Morgase exiled him from Caemlyn as per
      <A Href="#Gaebril">Gaebril</A>'s suggestion, but hopes he will still
      support her when she comes to claim the throne.
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> hopes he will support her claim to the
      throne.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Elza">Penfell, Elza</A>, p.
      302&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah.  She is one of the Aes Sedai now sworn
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>; she assisted in his kidnapping.  She is now
      one of <A Href="#Cadsuane">Cadsuane</A>'s companions.  She is secretly
      of the Black Ajah, but almost no one knows this.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Torval">Peral Torval</A>, p.
      68&mdash;One of <A Href="#Taim">Taim</A>'s close following Asha'man.  He is
      close to his middle years, and has a sharp nose.  He grew up in Tarabon.
      He was among those who tried to kill <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>.  <I>See

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Perrin">Perrin t'Bashere Aybara</A>, p.
      89&mdash;Young man from Emond's Field.  He is <I>ta'veren</I>.  When he and
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> got separated from the rest of the group
      while fleeing the Trollocs on Winternight, Perrin met a man named
      <A Href="#Elyas">Elyas Machera</A>.  Elyas, a former Warder who found he
      could talk to wolves, helped Perrin discover the same ability in
      himself.  Perrin's eyes are now yellow, just like the wolves' eyes, and
      he can enter what he calls the Wolf Dream (known to most as
      <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>, the World of Dreams) with them.  Perrin is a
      childhood friend of fellow <I>ta'veren</I>
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> and <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A>.  On
      the way to Tear, Perrin encountered a young woman by the name of
      <A Href="#Zarine">Zarine Bashere</A>, a Hunter for the Horn who
      took the name of <A Href="#Faile">Faile</A> (which means
      &quot;Falcon&quot; in the Old Tongue) as a more appropriate name for a
      Hunter for the Horn.  The two are now married.  Perrin is a very large
      man&mdash;he was always a big person, which caused him to be very cautious
      since he found as a child that he could easily hurt other children if
      his temper got out of hand.  His size helps considerably when helping
      <A Href="#Haral">Master Luhhan</A> on his forge, but sometimes gives
      others the impression that he is slow and stupid.  He returned to the
      Two Rivers for a time to repel the series of Trolloc attacks; he and his
      wife are recognized as Lord and Lady there, the first noblility of the
      Two Rivers since the Trolloc Wars.  When he returned, he began to draw
      the eye of <A Href="#Berelain">Berelain sur Paendrag Paeron</A>, the
      First of Mayene&mdash;Perrin wants nothing more than to be as far from her as
      possible, but Berelain will not take no for an answer, much to Faile's
      dismay and intense jealousy.  Perrin was instrumental in freeing Rand
      from his entrapment at Dumai's Wells; the two had a fight afterwards
      (they had planned it as a way for Perrin to leave, although they most
      likely did not plan on it being as violent as it was), and Perrin went
      to Ghealdan to see if he could tame <A Href="#Masema">Masema</A>.  On
      the way, his wife was captured by Shaido, and now he must track her
      down.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Rand">al'Thor, Rand</A>;

      brown gelding.  He does not look like much, but is actually a very good,
      sturdy horse.  He is stuck in the stable in the Tarasin Palace, and if
      Mat wants to leave Ebou Dar he will have to get him out.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Posavina">Master Posavina</A>,
      p. 593&mdash;Patron in <A Href="#Gallger">Mistress Gallger</A>'s inn who
      trades through Tear and Illian.  He was thinking of going through Tear
      because he heard that <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> was in Illian.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Powl">Powl</A>, p. 246&mdash;One of

      among them who is a Darkfriend, though the others would believe anything
      she told them and thus might be considered unwitting Darkfriends.

      necessarily sane anymore, but he has gained a very large following.
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> is getting to the point where he needs to do
      something about him, and sent <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A> to

      of the Forsaken.  He was fond of using Compulsion, and was known for
      being a ladies' man&mdash;he always had a woman on his arm.  After being
      released from the Bore, he took up residence in Caemlyn as
      <A Href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</A>, and used Compulsion to have
      <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A> not only make him her advisor, but
      her lover as well.  He eventually planned to take over the country
      directly as the first ever King of Andor&mdash;he did his best to weaken
      support for Morgase, exiling her supporters and befriending those who
      opposed her, finally chasing her from the country as well.  Shortly after
      news of Morgase's death or at least abdication reached Cairhien, Rahvin
      was confronted and killed by <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> in
      <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I> with a weave of balefire strong enough to burn

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, p. 32&mdash;Young man from
      Emond's Field in the Two Rivers, now proclaimed to be the
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  He is very tall, with curly
      red-blond hair.  He was raised by <A Href="#Tam">Tam al'Thor</A> and his
      wife <A Href="#Kari">Kari</A> (until her death around the time Rand was
      five) in Emond's Field.  His real parents, however, were
      <A Href="#Janduin">Janduin</A>, the chief of the Taardad Aiel who
      brought the four clans across the Dragonwall to punish
      <A Href="#Laman">Laman</A>'s Sin, and a Maiden of the Spear named
      <A Href="#Shaiel">Shaiel</A>, who was actually
      <A Href="#Tigraine">Tigraine Damodred</A>, the runaway Daughter-Heir of
      Andor.  Tigraine gave birth to Rand on the slopes of Dragonmount, in
      accordance with prophecy; &quot;born of a Maiden, of the ancient blood
      but raised by the Old.&quot;  Rand has a heron branded into each of his
      palms, which he received from the sword Tam gave him while fighting
      <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A>.  He also has two
      dragons on his forearms, which he received in Rhuidean to designate him
      as the <I><A Href="#Caracarn">Car'a'carn</A></I>, the Chief of Chiefs of
      the Aiel.  He is not only the Dragon Reborn, but also <A Href="#Dawn">He
      Who Comes With the Dawn</A>, the man prophecied to reunite the Aiel, and
      the <A Href="#Coramoor">Coramoor</A>, the one prophecied to bring the
      Sea Folk out of the Sea.  He can channel strongly, more so than any
      person who ever lived (except the previous user of his soul,
      <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A>, who was obviously of equal
      strength), and is also <I>ta'veren</I>, the most strongly so since Lews
      Therin as well.  Lews Therin's voice has somehow found a new place
      inside of Rand's head; he talks to him in a mad voice when Rand least
      expects it, sometimes offering sound advice or knowledge, sometimes
      babbling, sometimes even trying to wrest control of <I>saidin</I> from
      him.  Unlike Lews Therin, Rand is accompanied by two other
      <I>ta'veren</I> during this turing of the Wheel, two men born within
      days (hours, even) of him named <A Href="#Mat">Matrim Cauthon</A> and
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A>, who both grew up in Emond's Field
      as well.  Rand is destined to fall in love with three women (and has):
      <A Href="#Min">Min Farshaw</A>, <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</A>,
      and <A Href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</A>.  Rand has had success in fighting
      many of the Forsaken; all to confront him have died or been trapped.  He
      killed <A Href="#Aginor">Aginor</A> at the Eye of the World after the
      <A Href="../book1/alphalast.html#Green">Green Man</A> killed
      <A Href="#Balthamel">Balthamel</A>; he allowed
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> to kill <A Href="#Belal">Be'lal</A> in
      the Stone of Tear, and killed <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A> in the
      Stone shortly afterward; in the wagons near the Spine of the World,
      <A Href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</A> confronted him and was pushed into the
      land of the Eelfinn by Moiraine; he killed <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A>
      in <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I> when he came to the Royal Palace in Caemlyn;
      and <A Href="#Asmodean">Asmodean</A>, his teacher, was killed shortly
      after Rahvin met his fate.  His prophecies fulfilled grow:  he has
      already been born on the slopes of Dragonmount of a Maiden, of the
      ancient blood but raised by the old, taken the Stone of Tear and drawn
      <I>Callandor</I>, and began conquering &quot;under the forgotten
      symbol,&quot; that of the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  He is
      working on having the &quot;spotless tower&quot; (i.e. the White Tower)
      break and bend knee to him (the Tower has broken, and several Aes Sedai
      have sworn fealty to him and only him).  He has also been bonded by
      <A Href="#Alanna">Alanna Mosvani</A>, an Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah,
      against his will&mdash;the first such bonding in hundreds of years.  He plans
      to use the Choedan Kal, the two great <I>sa'angreal</I> created during
      the War of the Shadow, to cleanse the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>'s
      taint from <I>saidin</I>.  He plans to do it soon, to prevent further
      problems with his Asha'man, men who came for his &quot;amnesty&quot;
      against male channelers, going mad.  He is the salvation of the entire
      world, and as the prophecy states, he <I>will</I> save the world&mdash;and
      Break it again.

      fashion of her native Altara.  She has touches of white at her dark
      temples which emphasize a thin, age-faded white scar.  Only a Warder
      could match her for scowling.  She has held her chair in the Hall for
      forty years, and has worn the shawl for over 150.  Everyone knows to be
      wary of her temper.  She was born the daughter of an innkeeper, and was
      first trained by the Daughters of Silence (an organization similar to,
      but shorter-lived and smaller than, the Kin)&mdash;she was the only one of
      them to ever obtain the shawl.

      returned, he dethroned her and stripped her of all her titles and
      estates.  Rather than living in shame, she committed suicide.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Siuan">Sanche, Siuan</A>, p.
      311&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah.  Born in Tear to a fisherman, she was
      sent to the White Tower on the first boat to leave after she discovered
      she had the ability to channel inborn, according to Tairen law.  As a
      novice, she was good friends with <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine
      Damodred</A>, and was present at <A Href="#Gitara">Gitara Moroso</A>'s
      Foretelling of the Rebirth of the <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>.  After
      being raised to the shawl, she joined the Blue Ajah to dedicate her life
      to finding and guiding the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>, and
      eventually came to lead the Blues' network of eyes-and-ears (i.e. spies)
      before being raised to the <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>.  She was
      only thirty years old when raised to the Amyrlin Seat, making her the
      youngest Amyrlin to date.  She was also one of the strongest Amyrlins in
      recent history, and one of the most feared among the rulers of nations.
      Her blue-eyed stare was feared by all.  When her twenty-year connection
      to the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> was discovered, she and her
      <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A>, <A Href="#Leane">Leane
      Sharif</A>, were deposed and stilled by a group of sisters loyal to
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida a'Roihan</A>.  Siuan hoped to regain some of
      her previous standing in the new Tower that separated from Elaida&mdash;her
      knowledge of the Blue Ajah spy network is hard to match, and she knows
      much that she thinks would be of use.  In one of her viewings,
      <A Href="#Min">Min</A> saw that Siuan would have to remain close by to
      <A Href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</A>&mdash;if she did not, both of them would
      die.  Siuan did not initially know what she meant, but now realizes that
      she is growing to love the gray-haired man who leads the Salidar army.
      She had a Warder named <A Href="#Alric">Alric</A>, but he died when
      she was deposed.  After coming to Salidar,
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> discovered how to restore Siuan's ability
      to channel, at least partially.  This resurrected a part of her bond
      with Alric, but did not bring back her former strength, or her binding
      by the Oath Rod.  She can now lie as well as any child.  She now serves
      as an &ldquo;advisor&rdquo; to the new Amyrlin in Salidar,
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A>, but though she puts on a
      fa&ccedil;ade of hating the work, she is actually one of Egwene's
      foremost agents.  The fact that she is Aes Sedai, not to mention one who
      was stilled and Healed again, makes other sisters tend to be oblivious
      to this fact.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Alric">Alric</A>;

      it was deadlocked over four candidates who had each worn the shawl about
      fifty years; the Hall wanted an Amyrlin that was younger than the eighty
      or more years than were common.  Seaine suggested <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan
      Sanche</A>, then a young Blue sister that had worn the shawl for ten
      years; she was eventually raised.  Later, Seaine was charged by
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A> to find Darkfriends in the Tower; Elaida

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Semirhage">Semirhage</A>, p.
      313&mdash;One of the Forsaken.  During the Age of Legends, she was one of the
      best Healers ever known.  She was called to all corners of the world
      Heal people that others thought beyond help.  However, she was sadistic;
      she exacted a price in the form of pain from her subjects in return for
      her Healing services.  Most thought the pain or anguish she exacted from
      them was a small price to pay for being alive, but eventually the Hall
      of Servants found out about her practices and gave her the choice of
      being either severed or bound with the Power, never again to know her
      &quot;pleasures.&quot;  She chose instead to pledge for the
      <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>, and created one of the most oppressive and
      pain-filled areas of Shadow control during the entire War of Power.
      After being freed from the Bore, Semirhage went in service to the Dark
      One by extracting information from captured Borderlanders and Aes Sedai.
      She also sent the Trollocs to the Stone of Tear to battle those that
      <A Href="#Sammael">Sammael</A> sent.  She is as tall as most men, and
      wears black most of the time&mdash;perhaps because
      <A Href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</A> always wore white.  It is often joked (or
      used to be, when the Forsaken were still bound) that when it rained
      during the daylight that the Dark One was beating her.  <I>Note:  there
      are many theories as to who Semirhage is masquerading as.  The only
      suggestion I have heard at this point makes some sense:
      <A Href="#Anath">Anath</A>, <A Href="#Tuon">Tuon</A>'s sadistic

      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A> had a hand in her death; the Black Ajah did
      not.  In fact, <A Href="#Chesmal">Chesmal Emry</A> convinced the Red

      it fell and trying to rouse resistance among the rural nobles.  He is
      considering <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>'s offer of support if he
      declares himself king of Tear.  Needless to say, he hates Rand with a

      became a servant in the palace, dressed in the same clothing they wore
      and attempted to behave in their manner.  She ended her tenure as a
      servant when she learned that Rand had been captured, and led the
      rescue party of Maidens to Dumai's Wells.  She then went with
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A> to find <A Href="#Masema">Masema</A>, and

      is possibly the most skilled female Healer alive outside of
      <A Href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</A>.  She is stout.  Unfortunately,

      failure that was not hers to the <A Href="#Empress">Empress</A>.  She
      gathered all of the Seanchan ships that fled Falme so they would not go
      back home; she then retook portions of the mainland again, but was
      prevented from taking Illian by <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> and his

      be <A Href="#Seaine">Seaine</A>'s friend.  She has no Warders, which is

      shielded her because she suspected her of being Black Ajah, she tried to
      stab her.  She actually <I>is</I> a member of the Black Ajah, and is now

      <A Href="#Jarna">Jarna Malari</A>, then the head of the Black Ajah, with

      one of only three people present at Gitara's Foretelling of the Rebirth
      of the <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>.  This may be the information that

      Morgase had two children, <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A> and
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>.  He died when Elayne was barely old enough

      since novicehood, <A Href="#Seaine">Seaine</A>, are now leading a hunt
      for Darkfriends in the Tower.  Seaine approached her not only because
      they were friends, but because Seaine's family was killed by Darkfriends
      when she was young.  She joined the Red Ajah because its task was one
      which involved being outside the Tower often, and she considered it more
      likely to be able to find and bring to justice the Darkfriends that
      killed her family and others like them.  <I>See also</I>

      27&mdash;Captain-General of the Queen's Guards under
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>, and her Warder.  She is allegedly from
      Kandor.  She is actually Birgitte, a Hero of Legend, bound to the Horn
      of Valere until <A Href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</A> ripped her away.
      She has long blonde hair that she keeps in a braid, and is one of the
      best with bow and arrows in all human history.  During
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>'s struggle with Moghedien, Birgitte was
      ripped out of <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I> and almost died.  She would have if
      she had not been saved by <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>, who bonded her
      as a Warder to give her the strength and quick healing she
      needed to survive.  She is always linked to <A Href="#Gaidal">Gaidal
      Cain</A> in the stories, and misses him immensely since he was spun out
      normally while she was ripped out.  She is nothing like the stories say
      she is supposed to be like.  <I>See also</I>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Elayne">Trakand, Elayne</A>, p.
      24&mdash;The Daughter-Heir of Andor, now Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah.  She is
      the daughter of <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A> and her late husband,
      <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail</A>, and sister to
      <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>.  She is also half-sister to
      <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A>, although she would rather not be reminded of
      this fact; she thinks Galad virtuous to the point of fault, and does not
      really like him.  She has considerable potential in the One Power, and
      is one of the strongest Aes Sedai in a thousand years or more,
      possibly since the Age of Legends, with the exceptions of
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>, <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>,
      <A Href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</A>, and some trainees.  She has
      red-gold curly hair.  During her stay in the Stone of Tear, Elayne
      realized she loved <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, and told him how
      she felt; he felt similarly.  She had no idea at the time what
      <A Href="#Min">Min</A> meant about &quot;having to share him,&quot; but
      now knows about Min's viewing of Rand with the three women's heads,
      indicating that Rand will fall in love with Min, Elayne, and Aviendha,
      and they with him.  Later, when she and Nynaeve had trouble with
      <A Href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</A>, Elayne ended up bonding
      <A Href="#Birgitte">Birgitte</A> as her Warder (despite being only
      Accepted at the time) in order to save Birgitte's life.  Elayne later
      went to Ebou Dar and found the Bowl of the Winds, a <I>ter'angreal</I>
      that they used to fix the weather.  She has since returned to Andor upon
      hearing news of her mother's disappearance; she plans to take the Lion
      Throne, as soon as she has garnered enough support to keep it.

      <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A> of Andor and brother to
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>.  He will become First Prince of the Sword
      when Elayne becomes Queen.  He and his half-brother
      <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A> went to train with the Warders in the White
      Tower, as all sons of Andoran queens have for centuries, and both now
      possess considerable skill with the sword.  During the chaos that
      erupted after <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>'s deposition, Gawyn
      formed a band of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders
      except Galad, who are called the Younglings.  The Younglings fought back
      against their teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and
      <A Href="#Leane">Leane</A> from their imprisonment.  Gawyn himself
      killed Hammar and Coulin, the men in charge of teaching the sword and
      for his personal training, respectively, both of which were
      Blademasters&mdash;few Warders are as good as they were, and Gawyn managed to
      kill both of them.  With recent developments, Gawyn does not know which
      party to support&mdash;he believes that anyone who opposed Tower Law by
      trying to free Siuan and Leane was wrong, but at the same time he
      does not know all the facts surrounding the change in leadership.  In
      fact, his sister Elayne and her friends <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve
      al'Meara</A> and <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A> side with those
      who broke from the Tower, and Egwene, the woman he wants to marry, is
      their new leader.  He believes the rumor that <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>
      killed his mother, and only refrains from killing him because Egwene
      made him promise not to.  Gawyn has made many enemies inside and outside
      the Tower, just by leading the Younglings.  He detests Rand because he
      thinks Rand killed his mother (when in fact no one did), and there is no
      telling how he'll react when he finds out that Elayne actually does love
      him, as well as that Egwene heads the rebellion against the Tower.  His
      sign is a white boar.  <I>See also</I>

      was small, and she only ruled a portion of it; the rest was governed by

      her House to sit on the throne&mdash;this is the maximum traditionally, and
      the only House to hold it for four generations fell so fast from power
      that it could not recover.  She was advised by
