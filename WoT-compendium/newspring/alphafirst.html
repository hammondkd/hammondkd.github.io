  <li><i><a class="name" name="Aan">Aan&rsquo;allein</a></i>,
      p. 24&mdash;Name the Aiel
      use for <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>.  It means, roughly, &ldquo;One Man
      Alone&rdquo; or &ldquo;Man Who is an Entire People&rdquo; in the Old
      Tongue.

      p. 124&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah.
  <li><a class="name" name="Adine">Adine Canford</a>,
      p. 192&mdash;Plump,
      blue-eyed Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah with short-cut black hair.  She
      displays no hint of arrogance despite being raised in Andor.  She is not
      very strong in the One Power.  As Accepted, she was friends with
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> and <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a>, and
      now that they have been raised and have joined the Blue Ajah, that
      friendship has been renewed, thanks especially to their mutual friend,
      <a href="#Leane">Leane</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Aeldra">Aeldra Najaf</a>,
      p. 119&mdash;Keeper of the Chronicles
      under <a href="#Tamra">Tamra Ospenya</a>, appointed to
      replace <a href="#Gitara">Gitara Moroso</a> after her death.  She has
      white, straight hair cut short like <a href="#Kerene">Kerene</a>&rsquo;s.

      sharp nose.
  <li><a class="name" name="Aiko">Aiko</a>,
      p. 305&mdash;Plump, gray-haired servant in the Aesdaishar Palace in Chachin.
  <li><a class="name" name="Ailene">Ailene Tolvina</a>,
      p. 295&mdash;Innkeeper of
      The Evening Star, an inn in Chachin where
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> and <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a> stay.
      She is a lean woman with an air that brooks no nonsense.
  <li><a class="name" name="Aisha">Aisha Raveneos</a>,
      p. 118&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Gray Ajah.  <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a> gave her a similar
      message to the one <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> gave
      Karene.  She has a plain face, and could pass for
      a farmer&rsquo;s wife.
  <li><a class="name" name="Aisling">Aisling Noon</a>,
      p. 57&mdash;One of the
      Accepted.  She is very tall.  She is a rarity in the Tower, one of the
      Tuatha&rsquo;an, the Traveling People.  She spent five years as a novice, and
      was raised to Accepted the same year as <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>
      and <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Akarrin">Akarrin</a>,
      p. 45&mdash;Aes Sedai of the
      Brown Ajah.  She is very slender, and has quick eyes to catch
      <i>anyone</i> who is not following her lead.
  <li><a class="name" name="Akir">al&rsquo;Akir Mandragoran</a>,
      p. 207&mdash;The last
      king of Malkier, <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>&rsquo;s father.  He died about 24
      years ago when Malkier was overrun, shortly after Lan&rsquo;s birth.
      <i>See also</i>
      <a href="#Lan">Mandragoran, Lan</a>;
      <a href="#Leanna">ti Mandragoran, Leanna</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Alanna">Alanna Mosvani</a>,
      p. 59&mdash;One of the
      Accepted.  She is shy, but she works hard at being fierce.  She wants to
      be a Green and have a dozen Warders.  She is always exaggerating.  At
      the meeting at which <a href="#Tamra">Tamra</a> announced her plan for the
      bounty, she asked if the Accepted would be allowed to defend themselves
      with the One Power.  The answer was no.
  <li><a class="name" name="Aldecain">Aldecain Damodred</a>,
      p. 95&mdash;One of
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>&rsquo;s uncles, and one of
      <a href="#Laman">Laman</a>&rsquo;s brothers.  Moiraine thinks he and his
      brother <a href="#Moressin">Moressin</a> are even worse than Laman,
      each having heat enough for ten men, which they expressed in anger and
      cruelty, as well as contempt for Moiraine&rsquo;s father.

      <a href="#Taringail">Damodred, Taringail</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Aledrin">Aledrin</a>,
      p. 56&mdash;One of the Accepted.  <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> heard her speculating
      that <i>all</i> Accepted were to test for the shawl immediately at the
      assembly in the Oval Lecture Hall where <a href="#Tamra">Tamra</a>
      announced her plan to pay bounty.  She is very excitable.
  <li><a class="name" name="Alin">Alin Seroku</a>,
      p. 207&mdash;Bluff, graying Saldaean officer with white scars on his face.
      He soldiered for 40 years along the Blight.
  <li><a class="name" name="Alys">Alys</a>,
      p. 223&mdash;<a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>&rsquo;s alias while traveling, in order
      to conceal her identity.
      <i>See</i>
      <a href="#Moiraine">Damodred, Moiraine</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Amira">Amira</a>,
      p. 197&mdash;Stocky Aes Sedai
      of the Red Ajah with long beaded braids.
      She is the new <a href="#Novices">Mistress of Novices</a> under
      <a href="#Sierin">Sierin Vayu</a>.  It is tradition to appoint a
      Mistress of Novices from the Ajah one was raised from, but Sierin was
      raised from the Gray while Amira was from the Red.  However, most think
      of Sierin as more Red than Gray anyway.
  <li><a class="name" name="Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>,
      p. 26&mdash;Leader of the
      Aes Sedai, their equivalent of a king or queen.  Her authority is
      immense&mdash;rulers of all nations will obey a summons to the
      Amyrlin, even if they will spend the entire journey devising a plan to
      kill her while there.  The Amyrlin, once raised, is considered to be
      &ldquo;of all Ajahs and none&rdquo;&mdash;she wears a stole striped with
      the seven colors of the Ajahs.  The current Amyrlin is
      <a href="#Tamra">Tamra Ospenya</a>, raised from the Blue Ajah.
      <i>See also</i>
      <a href="#Tamra">Ospenya, Tamra</a>;

  <li><a class="name" name="Anaiya">Anaiya</a>,
      p. 136&mdash;Aes Sedai of the
      Blue Ajah.  Her plain features make her look more like a farmer than a
      sister.  She was present at <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>&rsquo;s test for
      the shawl.  She has a comforting air; almost any conversation with her
      turns out comforting.
  <li><a class="name" name="Andro">Andro</a>,
      p. 89&mdash;<a href="#Meilyn">Meilyn</a>&rsquo;s Warder.  He is lean, and no taller
      than his mistress.  He appears youthful until one notices his eyes.

  <li><a class="name" name="Anlee">Anlee</a>,
      p. 158&mdash;Grave-faced, graying

      <a href="#Jarene">Materasu, Jarene</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Anvaere">Anvaere Damodred</a>,
      p. 110&mdash;<a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>&rsquo;s older sister.  She cares for
      horses, hawking, and little else.  She also has a temper&mdash;no
      one wants her on the Sun Throne.

      p. 64&mdash;<a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>&rsquo;s
      horse.  She purchased her to celebrate being raised to Accepted.  She is
      not tall, though she has more stamina than larger horses.  She is fast,
      too, and a good jumper.
  <li><a class="name" name="Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</a>,
      p. 15&mdash;Legendary
      emperor who lived about a thousand years ago.  He conquered most of the
      known world, and the present-day nations were carved from his
      empire.

      p. 226&mdash;Gray-haired
      wilder staying in The Gates of Heaven, an inn in Canluum.  A merchant,

      p. 231&mdash;Woman on

      out to be Ravinda.  She is plump, and has graying hair.

      p. 108&mdash;<a href="#WillaMandair">Willa</a>&rsquo;s infant son.  He was born
      &ldquo;in sight of Dragonmount,&rdquo; which is ridiculous; the mountain
      is visible for miles and miles in every direction from Tar Valon.
      <i>See also</i>
      <a href="#WillaMandair">Mandair, Willa</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Brendas">Brendas</a>,

      She and <a href="#Temaile">Temaile</a> were assigned to the

      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> and <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a> took
      over.  She is usually quite sensible.
  <li><a class="name" name="Brys">Brys Materasu</a>,
      p. 280&mdash;Prince Consort of Kandor.
      By law, he must remain in the city of Chachin if
      <a href="#Ethenielle">Queen Ethenielle</a> is out of the city, and she
      must remain there if he is abroad.  He is stocky, rough-hewn, and in his
      middle years.  He appears more suited to armor than silks, though he
      wears neither well.  He has a strong reputation as a general, which is
      why he is Prince Consort, Swordbearer, and general of her armies.
      He is solidly built, and has green eyes.

      with the task of carrying the infant prince of Malkier to safety when
      the nation was overrun; he is the only one still alive.  Bluff and
      broad, he is taller than most men, almost as tall as Lan.  His hair is
      solid gray, which he wears cut to the shoulder according to Malkieri
      tradition, held back by the <i>hadori</i>, a thin braided leather cord.
      He has blue eyes.
  <li><a class="name" name="Bulen">Bulen</a>,
      p. 279&mdash;Lanky young servant in

  <li><a class="name" name="Cadsuane">Cadsuane Melaidhrin</a>,
      p. 228&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Green Ajah.  She has iron-gray hair and black eyes, and
      always wears ornaments in her hair.  She is the only woman who Moiraine
      knows that is considerably stronger than Moiraine herself is in the
      Power.  She was presumed dead until she appeared during the Aiel War.
      It is said she bent Tower law whenever it suited her, flouted custom,
      and always did her own thing, often dragging others with her.  It is
      whispered that she even assaulted an <a href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin</a>
      once.  <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> knows this cannot be true&mdash;she
      would have been executed&mdash;but she also admits that where her friend
      <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a> was born to lead, Cadsuane was born to
      <i>command</i>.  She is the strongest Aes Sedai in the Tower for the
      past 1000 years.
  <li><a class="name" name="Cal">Cal</a>,
      p. 305&mdash;Young footman in the

      the <a href="#Ines">Lady Ines</a>.  He has pretty brown eyes.
  <li><a class="name" name="Caniedrin">Caniedrin</a>,
      p. 19&mdash;Beardless young
      man among <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>&rsquo;s troops.  The young Kandori is an
      efficient, experienced soldier, and an archer of rare skill.  An almost
      cheerful killer, he often laughs while he fights.
  <li><a class="name" name="Careme">Careme Mowly</a>,
      p. 80&mdash;Young mother
      from Murandy.  Her daughter is <a href="#Sedrin">Sedrin</a>&rsquo;s age, to
      the day.  Her future husband ran off to become a Warder, and she does
      not like the man she actually <i>did</i> marry nearly as much.  She
      wants very little to do with the White Tower.
      <i>See also</i>
      <a href="#Ellya">Mowly, Ellya</a>.
  <li><a class="name" name="Carewin">Carewin Damodred</a>,
      p. 173&mdash;<a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>&rsquo;s great-grandmother.  She ruled
      Cairhien for over fifty years.  The White Tower would call her a very
      successful ruler because Cairhien prospered and had few wars during her
      reign.  However, her name is still used to frighten children in
      Cairhien.

      p. 201&mdash;Captain of
      <i>Bluewing</i>, the ship <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> hires to
      take her out of Tar Valon.  He is a wide, sun-darkened man with narrow
      mustaches he keeps waxed to spikes.
  <li><a class="name" name="CatDancer">Cat Dancer</a>,
      p. 19&mdash;<a href="#Lan">Lan</a>&rsquo;s bay
      stallion.  He is still being trained as a warhorse.

      of the Blue Ajah.  She is as strong as <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>
      and <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a> will be when they reach full potential.
      She is tall and square-faced, with steel-gray hair in a multitude of
      braids to her waist.  She is the head of the Blue Ajah eyes-and-ears,
      the best spy network in the world.
  <li><a class="name" name="Chesmal">Chesmal Emry</a>,
      p. 238&mdash;Aes Sedai of
      the Yellow Ajah, a very talented Healer.  She announced that
      <a href="#Meilyn">Meilyn</a> had died in her bed; this was not
      possible, since <a href="#Siuan">Siuan</a> hid under the same bed, fell
      asleep there, and woke up the next morning to find that the bed had not
      been slept in.
  <li><a class="name" name="Coladara">Coladara</a>,

  <li><a class="name" name="CyrilWynn">Cyril Wynn</a>,

      bounty the White Tower is paying for newborns in honor of the battle, but
      <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a> added him to the list anyway&mdash;she
      reasoned that the Tower could provide 100 crowns to help the

      rookery by the women in the line.
  <li><a class="name"">Dark One</a>,
      p. 12&mdash;Name, used in every land, for
      <a href="#Dark">Shai&rsquo;tan</a>, because using his real name causes bad

      He was imprisoned by the Creator at the moment of Creation in a prison
      just outside the Pattern.  This prison was bored into during the Age of
      Legends; the Dark One&rsquo;s touch on the world produced new waves of hate,
      crime, and violence that had never been seen before.  An attempt to free
      the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow, a war which
      ended only with the sealing of the Bore by
      Lews Therin Telamon and the Hundred Companions.
      During the moment of sealing, the Dark One&rsquo;s counterstroke tainted
      <i>saidin</i> itself, beginning the Time of Madness.
      The seals on the prison were made of <i>cuendillar</i>,
      an indestructible substance, but nonetheless are beginning to weaken.
      The Dark One may touch the world again soon.  Speaking his true name
      draws his attention and causes bad luck, so he is known by a plethora of

      reasons.  Three sisters were exiled from Tar Valon for a year, and two

      between their incomes and lifestyles as children, they found they had a
      remarkable amount in common.  The two moved at nearly the same rate
      through their work with the Power, but Siuan seems to learn things like
      history, language, and politics at a much faster rate.  In fact, she
      arrived at the Tower barely able to read, and now she teaches
      introductory classes in the Old Tongue.  She has very fair skin, clear
