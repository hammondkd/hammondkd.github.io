  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Lan">al'Lan Mandragoran Dai
      Shan</A>, p. 637&mdash;Malkieri noble, son of <A Href="#Akir">al'Akir
      Mandragoran</A>, the last King of Malkier, and
      <A Href="#Leanna">el'Leanna</A>, the last Queen.  He would be king of
      Malkier if he raised the Golden Crane&mdash;if he did so, people would follow.
      At his birth, shortly before the Trollocs overran Malkier and the Blight
      consumed his homeland, Lan was given four gifts (while still in his
      cradle):  a gold signet ring, a locket, a sword, and an oath.  Lan and
      his surviving Malkieri companions are the last of their people.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Bukama">Bukama Marenellein</A>, p.
      638&mdash;Man who raised <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A> after his parents were killed.
      He <I>always</I> glowers, even when offering praise.  He is also from
      Malkier, and like Lan is quite tall.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Dark">Dark One</A>, p. 639&mdash;Name,
      used in every land, for Shai'tan, the source of all evil, complete
      antithesis of the <A Href="#Creator">Creator</A> in every way.  He was
      imprisoned by the Creator at the moment of Creation in a prison just
      outside the Pattern.  This prison was bored into during the Age of
      Legends; the Dark One's touch on the world produced new waves of hate,
      crime, and violence that had never been seen before.  An attempt to free
      the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow, a war which
      ended only with the sealing of the Bore by <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin
      Telamon</A> and the Hundred Companions.  During the moment of sealing,
      the Dark One's counterstroke tainted <I>saidin</I> itself, beginning the
      Time of Madness.  The seals on the prison were made of <I>cuendillar</I>,
      and indestructible substance, but nonetheless are beginning to weaken.
      The Dark One may touch the world again soon.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Varan">Varan Marcasiev</A>, p.
      639&mdash;High Seat of House Marcasiev.  He is a very proud man.

      Blight.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Akir">al'Akir Mandragoran</A>, p.
      640&mdash;<A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>'s father, and the last king of Malkier.  He
      died when Malkier was overrun by the Trollocs and swallowed by the
      Blight.
