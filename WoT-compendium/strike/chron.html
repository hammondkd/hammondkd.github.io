  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Dark">Dark One</A>, p. 1&mdash;Source of all evil,

      Forsaken.  His army attacked almost on the heels of
      <A Href="#Sammael">Sammael</A>'s forces, eventually leading
      <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin</A> to his decision to carry out his plan
      with or without help from the female Aes Sedai.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Belal">Be'lal</A>, p. 13&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  His army attacked almost on the heels of
      <A Href="#Sammael">Sammael</A>'s forces, eventually leading

      with or without help from the female Aes Sedai.
