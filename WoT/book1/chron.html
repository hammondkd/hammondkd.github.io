  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A>, p.
      ix&mdash;The <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>, <A Href="#Morning">Lord of
      the Morning</A>, <A Href="#Kinslayer">Kinslayer</A>, Breaker of the
      World.  He is a tall man just into his middle years.
      He was handsome once, but now he has more white hair than brown,
      and his face is lined from strain and worry.  He has dark eyes.
      Known as the Dragon during the War of the Shadow.
      He killed his entire family in the madness that seized him
      after resealing the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>'s prison.  <I>See

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Ilyena">Ilyena Therin Moerelle</A>, p.
      ix&mdash;Wife of <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A>.  She has
      blonde hair.  She was called &quot;Sunhair.&quot;  She died along with
      her children when her insane husband killed them, and her.
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Lews">Telamon, Lews Therin</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Morning">Lord of the Morning</A>, p.
      x&mdash;Title by which <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A> was known
      by during the Age of Legends and the War of Power.  <I>See also</I>

      <A Href="#Lews">Telamon, Lews Therin</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Dark">Shai'tan</A>, p. x&mdash;Source
      of all evil, antithesis of the <A Href="#Creator">Creator</A>.  He was
      imprisoned by the Creator at the moment of Creation at Shayol Ghul.
      This prison was bored into during the Age of Legends, which led to the
      War of the Shadow, the Time of Madness, the Breaking of the World, and
      the end of the Age of Legends.  Since naming him by his true name brings
      ill fortune or disaster, many euphemisms exist, including Father of
      Lies, Grassburner, Heartsbane, Heartfang, Leafblighter, Lord of the
      Grave, Shepherd of the Night, Sightblinder, and Soulsbane.  He is most
      commonly referred to as simply &quot;The Dark One.&quot;
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Elan">Elan Morin Tedronai</A>, p.
      x&mdash;Man who appears to <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A> shortly
      after he killed his entire family.  He Healed Lews Therin from his
      madness, allowing him to finally realize what he had done.  Elan Morin
      is now known as <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A>, which means
      &quot;<A Href="#Betrayer">Betrayer of Hope</A>&quot; in the Old Tongue.
      He claims to follow a &quot;different power&quot; now, that of the
      <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A> himself.  He was once humbled by Lews
      Therin in the Hall of Servants, and defeated by him at the gates of
      Paaren Disen.  However, Lews Therin fled and killed himself before
      Elan Morin could do with him as he had planned.  <I>See also</I>

      <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A> during the
      War of the Shadow.  He did not like the name.  The name is now
      associated with evil, since Lews Therin killed his entire family in his
      madness at the end of his life.  It is said the Dragon will be Reborn at
      mankind's greatest hour of need to save the world&mdash;and Break it
      again.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>;

      xi&mdash;Title <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A> wore the ring of.

<H3>Chapter 1:  An Empty Road</H3>
<Img Src="../chapters/snakewheel.gif" Alt="chapter icon" Width="96" Height="97">
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, p.
      1&mdash;Shepherd from the Two Rivers.  He is a head taller than his father
      <A Href="#Tam">Tam</A>, and has grey eyes and reddish hair, both of
      which are rare in the Two Rivers.  Tam claims they come from his mother,
      <A Href="#Kari">Kari</A>, who died when Rand was five.  Rand is now
      twenty years old, and good friends with <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A>
      and <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A>.  He and
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A>, the Mayor's daughter, have been
      all but Promised to each other&mdash;this is often the subject of
      ridicule by Mat and Perrin.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Kari">al'Thor, Kari</A>;
      <A Href="#Tam">al'Thor, Tamlin</A>;
      <A Href="#Egwene">al'Vere, Egwene</A>;

      <A Href="#Mat">Cauthon, Matrim</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Tam">Tamlin (Tam) al'Thor</A>,
      p. 2&mdash;<A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s father, a shepherd in the Two Rivers.
      He has a thick, broad chest and a broad face, gray hair with black
      streaks in it.  His cheeks have been roughened by the sun.  He is a
      solid man.  Keeping his word is important to him.  When Tam was young,
      he left the Two Rivers to see the outside world, something which is
      extremely rare in the Two Rivers.  While there he acquired a sword, and
      married <A Href="#Kari">Kari</A>, a woman from Caemlyn.  Since Kari's
      death fifteen years ago, Tam has raised Rand himself.  Since Tam has
      been alone and without a wife for so long, many women in Emond's Field
      have been trying to find a match for him recently.  They've also started
      to think about who would be good for his son as well.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Kari">al'Thor, Kari</A>;
      <A Href="#Rand">al'Thor, Rand</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Bela">Bela</A>, p.
      2&mdash;<A Href="#Tam">Tam</A>'s work horse, a white shaggy mare.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Mat">Matrim (Mat) Cauthon</A>, p. 4&mdash;Young
      man from Emond's Field.  He is tall, and has brown eyes.  He is
      a wiry man.  Mat is known for his practical jokes and other mischief,
      even at age twenty.  Whenever something goes wrong in Emond's Field, Mat
      is the one everyone looks to.  He is good friends with
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> and <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin
      Aybara</A>.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Rand">al'Thor, Rand</A>;

      <A Href="#Abell">Cauthon, Abell</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A>, p.
      4&mdash;Young man from Emond's field.  He is about half a head shorter than
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>, one of his two best friends.  He's also a fair
      bit shorter than <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>, his other best friend.  He has
      curly hair, and is very stocky and generally big.  His frame works well
      for his chosen trade, working as apprentice to <A Href="#Haral">Haral
      Luhhan</A>, the blacksmith of Emond's Field.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Rand">al'Thor, Rand</A>;

      <A Href="#Haral">Luhhan, Haral</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A>, p.
      5&mdash;Young woman from Emond's Field.  She is about eighteen years old,
      and just earned the right to wear her hair in a braid, the symbol of
      womanhood.  She is the daughter of <A Href="#Bran">Bran</A>, the Mayor
      of Emond's Field, and his wife <A Href="#Marin">Marin</A>.  She is of a
      height with <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>, barely up to
      <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>'s shoulder.  She has big brown eyes.  She and
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> are all but Promised to eachother&mdash;this subject
      makes Rand uncomfortable, and is often used to needle him by his
      friends.  Nynaeve told Egwene that she has the ability to Listen to the
      Wind, a Talent that all Wisdoms claim to possess but few actually do.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Cenn">Cenn Buie</A>, p.
      6&mdash;Thatcher in Emond's Field.  He is old and haggard, and speaks with a
      raspy voice.  He sits on the Village Council, but is probably the most
      disagreeable member on it.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Wit">Wit Congar</A>, p. 6&mdash;Man
      from Emond's Field.  He and his family are reknowned troublemakers and
      complainers.  He is scrawny, unlike his quite solid wife,

      Marin</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</A>, p.
      7&mdash;Wisdom of Emond's Field.  She has brown hair and eyes, and is quite
      slender.  She is about as tall as <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>'s shoulder.
      Many people in the village think she is too young to be the Wisdom,
      however, mentioning this to her is a good way to get whacked by the
      stick she carries.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Daise">Daise Congar</A>, p.
      7&mdash;<A Href="#Wit">Wit</A>'s wife.  She is twice as wide as he is.  She

      husband much more than he controls her.  <I>See also</I>

      <A Href="#Bran">Bran al'Vere</A> fix the problem that no storks were
      nesting on the rooftops this spring.  He honestly does not know what she
      would have him do.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Dav">Dav Ayellin</A>, p.
      11&mdash;Young man from Emond's Field, of an age with <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>.
