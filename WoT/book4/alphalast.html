  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Elaida">Elaida do Avriny
      a'Roihan</A>, p. 36 (22)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Red Ajah.  She is one of
      the more powerful of the Aes Sedai.  She served as advisor to
      <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase of Andor</A>, a position she sought
      after she had a Foretelling about the importance of the Royal Family of
      Andor.  Elaida is the only Aes Sedai alive to have any real strength in
      the Fortelling&mdash;the last Aes Sedai to actually have regular
      Foretellings was <A Href="#Gitara">Gitara Moroso</A>,
      now dead over twenty years.  Elaida keeps her own agenda,
      and is very suspicious (as all Reds are) of Blue Ajah activities,
      especially those of <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> and
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A> (Elaida still considers the Amyrlin to be of
      the Blue Ajah, not of&nbsp; &#8220;all Ajahs and none&rdquo;).
      Elaida's Foretelling about the
      importance of the Andoran Royal Family occurred during the Third War of
      Andoran Succession, after which Morgase took the throne.  Thus, her
      Foretelling might have, and most likely <Em>did</Em>, refer to the then
      current Royal Family, that of <A Href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</A>,
      <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail</A>,
      <A Href="#Luc">Luc</A>, and <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aan"><I>Aan'allein</I></A>, p. 375
      (333)&mdash;What the Aiel call <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>.  The name means
      &ldquo;One Man,&rdquo; or &ldquo;He who is an entire people.&rdquo;
      This obviously refers to Lan's being the last surviving Malkieri.
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Lan">Mandragoran, Lan</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Logain">Ablar, Logain</A>, p.
      231 (202)&mdash;False Dragon who led Ghealdan, Altara, and Amadicia to
      civil war before being captured and gentled by Aes Sedai.
      He was quite strong in the One Power.
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Adan">Adan</A>, p. 416
      (371)&mdash;<A Href="#Lewin">Lewin</A>'s greatfather.  He appears in
      steps four, five, and six of <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s viewings.
      Adan was not only the grandfather of the man who headed the group that
      broke from the Aiel to form what are now called the Aiel, but also was
      the leader of the Aiel when some of them decided their path was
      incorrect and split off to form a new band of people that did not serve
      the Aes Sedai, instead carrying their own possessions in the wagons.
      These people are now called the Tuatha'an, the Traveling People,
      and are the only people in the world that still follow the Way of the
      Leaf.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Jonai">Jonai</A>;
      <A Href="#Lewin">Lewin</A>;
      <A Href="#Suluin">Suluin</A>
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Adelin">Adelin</A>, p. 597 (538)&mdash;Maiden of
      the Spear who comes back from scouting to tell
      <A Href="#Rhuarc">Rhuarc</A> about the trouble at Imre Stand that they
      found.  She is of the Jindo sept of the Taardad Aiel.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aedomon">Aedomon</A>, p. 610 (550)&mdash;Man who
      led the Saferi down on unsuspecting Manetheren years ago.
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Buiryn">Buiryn</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aeldra">Aeldra</A>, p. 211 (182)&mdash;Woman the
      man <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> sees in
      <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I> is looking for.  Since he was only dreaming and
      entered the World of Dreams by accident, she wasn't there for him.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aginor">Aginor</A>, p. 182 (155)&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  He was the second one to be released from the
      sealing on the Bore.  He was trapped close to the surface of the Bore,
      so he was not shielded from the passing of time very effectively; he
      emerged as a <Em>very</Em> old man, so old that his face was so wrinkled
      one could barely make out his features anymore.  He was killed by
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> at the Eye of the World.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Kenley">Ahan, Kenley</A>, p. 537 (484)&mdash;One
      of <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A>'s recruits.  He knows his way
      around Watch Hill better than anyone else in the group.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Ahan">Mistress Ahan</A>, p. 699
      (631)&mdash;<A Href="#Kenley">Kenley</A>'s mother.  A handsome woman
      with streaks of white in her black braid.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Toma">Ahmid, Toma dur</A>, p. (893)&mdash;Person
      who devised the Toman Calendar, which was adopted approximately two
      hundred years after the death of the last male Aes Sedai and continued
      until the Trolloc Wars.  The Calendar recorded years After the Breaking,
      or AB.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Kevrim">al'Azar, Kevrim</A>, p. 929
      (844)&mdash;Very old man from Emond's Field.  His grandsons have grown
      sons of their own.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Nela">al'Caar, Nela</A>, p. 729 (659)&mdash;Woman
      from Emond's Field.  She wanted to ask <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A> if
      it was safe for children to play in some parts of the city.  She already
      knew the answer, but she thought she should ask him, anyway.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="PaetalCaar">al'Caar, Paetram (Paet)</A>, p.
      (844)&mdash;Citizen of Emond's Field.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="alDai">al'Dai, Bili</A>, p. 537 (484)&mdash;Oldest
      of the people who join <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A> on his
      strike to free the Emond's Fielders who are being held prisoner by the
      Children of the Light (except for <A Href="#Tam">Tam</A> and
      <A Href="#Abell">Abell</A>).
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="HualDai">al'Dai, Hu</A>, p. 632
      (632)&mdash;<A Href="#alDai">Bili</A>'s father.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Nynaeve">al'Meara, Nynaeve</A>, p. 22 (9)&mdash;A
      young woman from Emond's Field, now one of the Accepted.  She
      has exceptional potential, and will most likely be the most powerful Aes
      Sedai since the Age of Legends.  However, Nynaeve's channeling is
      obstructed due to the fact that she had to learn to control her ability
      herself without really knowing what she was controlling: she is a
      wilder.  She can only touch the True Source when she is extremely angry
      (thereby letting her guard down and circumventing her block).
      Along with <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene<A> and <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>,
      Nynaeve is one of three people <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> trusts
      in the Tower; Siuan is convinced through their actions to date that they
      cannot possibly be Darkfriends.  She sent them on a dangerous mission:
      spring the obvious trap the Black Ajah had set for them,
      and see if they can catch them in the process.
      Nynaeve has developed feelings for <A Href="#Lan">Lan Mandragoran</A>,
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>'s Warder, and he shares those feelings
      despite his insistence that it is inappropriate and dangerous to act on
      them.  Nynaeve blames Moiraine herself for disrupting her village's life
      and endangering the lives of the four people she spirited away when the
      Trollocs attacked Emond's Field.  She wishes to learn how to control her
      ability so she can get even&mdash;to put Moiraine in her place, as it
      were&mdash;and to study and perfect the art of Healing.
      She is currently in the Stone of Tear, following the aftermath of the
      battle with <A Href="#Belal">Be'lal</A> and the taking of the Stone.
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Lan">Mandragoran, Lan</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Astelle">al'Seen, Astelle</A>, p. 519
      (468)&mdash;Oldest of the al'Seen family.  She uses her cane to thump
      people who are in her way more often than to walk with.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Ban">al'Seen, Bandry (Ban)</A>, p. 535
      (482)&mdash;<A Href="#Wil">Wil</A>'s cousin, <A Href="#Jac">Jac</A>'s
      son.  He got all of the nose in his family (it is not clear whether this
      means he has a really huge nose, or whether he's the only one in the
      family with a nice nose).
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Elisa">al'Seen, Elisa</A>, p. 522
      (470)&mdash;<A Href="#Jac">Jac</A>'s wife.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Jac">al'Seen, Jac</A>, p. 515 (464)&mdash;Farmer
      at whose farm <A Href="#Tam">Tam</A> plans to stop at around
      noon on the way to Watch Hill.  Jac took in many of the people from
      surrounding farms when their farms were attacked by Trollocs.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Wil">al'Seen, Wil</A>, p. 520 (468)&mdash;A cousin
      of <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A>'s from Deven Ride.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Wit2">al'Seen, Wit</A>, p. 519
      (468)&mdash;<A Href="#Jac">Jac al'Seen</A>'s cousin.  Jac took his
      family in because Wit's farm was too close to the Westwood, and thus
      likely to be attacked by Trollocs.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Dael">al'Taron, Dael</A>, p. 671 (606)&mdash;One of
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A>'s recruits.  He was killed by
      the Trollocs when they attacked the patrol from behind.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="alTaron">al'Taron, Mistress</A>, p. 700
      (632)&mdash;<A Href="#Dael">Dael</A>'s mother.  She keeps asking where
      he is when <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A> and his team come back.  Perrin
      feels awful because he hasn't the heart to tell her that her son is
      dead, most likely in the stomach of a Trolloc, because he wasn't
      prepared.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Kari">al'Thor, Kari</A>, p. 373
      (331)&mdash;<A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s mother.  Kari was not actually
      his biological mother; Rand's real mother was a Maiden of the Spear who
      bore him on Dragonmount where he was found by Kari's husband,
      <A Href="#Tam">Tam</A>.  Kari met Tam while he was stationed in Caemlyn
      during his military duties, and the two got married.  They returned to
      Tam's home, Emond's Field, with the child he found on the mountain at the
      end of the Aiel War, which they named Rand.  Kari died when Rand was
      about five years old; she was the only mother Rand ever knew, and all he
      remembers of her is her soft touch.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Rand">al'Thor, Rand</A>, p. 17 (4)&mdash;The
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  He was raised as a
      shepherd in Emond's Field, but his birthplace was on the slopes of
      Dragonmount.  His father, <A Href="#Tam">Tam</A>, found him freezing
      cold and orphaned while fighting Aiel on the mountain, and took him
      home with him and raised him as a son.  Rand is <I>ta'veren</I>,
      perhaps the most strongly so since the <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>
      himself, even more strongly than <A Href="#Hawkwing">Artur
      Hawkwing</A>.  Rand has already fulfilled many prophecies of the
      <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>, including being born on the slopes of
      Dragonmount, being marked with herons on his palms, and taking the
      Stone of Tear and <I>Callandor</I>.  According to
      <A Href="#Min">Min</A>'s viewings, Rand is destined to fall in love
      with three women, one of which is Min, and the other of which is
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>.  The third is unknown to Min, and Rand
      as well.  Rand is fated to one day face the <A Href="#Dark">Dark
      One</A> himself in Tarmon Gai'don, the Last Battle.  He is quite
      tall, as tall as most Aiel men.  Rand fights the Shadow along with
      his childhood friends, <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A> and
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A>, who are also <I>ta'veren</I>,
      but much weaker.  Rand is also very good friends with fellow Emond's
      Fielder <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A>&mdash;Rand and
      Egwene were expected to marry by everyone in the village including
      themselves, but they realized that their feelings for each other were
      more like siblings than like spouses.  Rand is the destiny of the
      entire world&mdash;should he die, the hope for the world would most
      likely die with him.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Tam">al'Thor, Tamlin (Tam)</A>, p. 152
      (128)&mdash;<A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s father.  He taught Rand about the
      Flame and the Void, a trick he uses to concentrate and to win archery
      competitions; Rand found that it is the way he can gain access to
      <I>saidin</I>.  Tam is not actually Rand's biological father; he found
      Rand as a newborn on the slopes of Dragonmount and took him home with
      him since Rand's mother was dead.  He was at Dragonmount as part of the
      Aiel War, which he left home to participate in when he was young.  He
      became an officer in the Illianer army, and even achieved Blademaster
      status, acquiring a heron-mark sword.  He married a woman from Caemlyn,
      <A Href="#Kari">Kari</A>, whom he met while stationed there.  When the
      Aiel War started, he fought Aiel all the way to Tar Valon and the Battle
      of the Shining Walls, where he found Rand on the mountain.  Tam and Kari
      raised Rand as their own son.  Tam always won the archery competitions
      (or came in second to <A Href="#Abell">Abell Cauthon</A>), and passed
      his archery skills on to Rand.  Tam never knew that the
      child he was raising was the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Bran">al'Vere, Brandelwyn (Bran)</A>, p. 469
      (421)&mdash;Mayor of Emond's Field and owner of the
      Winespring Inn.  He is <A Href="#Marin">Marin</A>'s husband and
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>'s father.  As mayor, he heads the Village
      Council, and has to deal with the Wisdom should it be necessary to deal
      with the Women's Circle.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Egwene">al'Vere,
      Egwene</A>; <A Href="#Marin">al'Vere, Marin</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Egwene">al'Vere, Egwene</A>, p. 22 (9)&mdash;A
      young woman from Emond's Field, now one of the Accepted.  She has
      considerable potential with the One Power, and will most likely be one
      of the strongest Aes Sedai in over a thousand years.  It is also thought
      that she may be the first Dreamer in the Tower in almost 500 years.
      Egwene is good friends with <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</A>, the
      Daughter-Heir of Andor, and is also a childhood friend of
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon
      Reborn</A>.  In fact, Rand and Egwene were all but Promised in their
      youth, but both of them feels an almost sibling-like love for each other
      now; they know that they cannot get married, and do not really want to
      (though they have yet to reveal these sentiments to each other).
      Egwene is the love interest of both of Elayne's brothers,
      <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A> and <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>&mdash;she is
      flattered by Galad's attentions, but she does not return them;
      she does find Gawyn to her liking, however.
      Egwene, along with Elayne and <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> is one of
      the only people <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> trusts in the Tower;
      Siuan is convinced through their actions to date that they cannot
      possibly be Darkfriends.  She sent them on a dangerous mission:  spring
      the obvious trap the Black Ajah had set for them, and see if they can
      catch them in the process.
      Egwene is currently in the Stone of Tear, following the aftermath of the
      battle with <A Href="#Belal">Be'lal</A> and the taking of the Stone.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Marin">al'Vere, Marin</A>, p. 470
      (422)&mdash;<A Href="#Bran">Bran</A>'s wife, and
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>'s mother.  She is used to getting her way
      most of the time.  She is an important figure in the Women's Circle of
      Emond's Field.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Bran">al'Vere, Brandelwyn</A>;
      <A Href="#Egwene">al'Vere, Egwene</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Ala">Ala</A>, p. 706 (637)&mdash;Ogier,
      mother of <A Href="#Damelle">Damelle</A>, daughter of
      <A Href="#Soferra">Soferra</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Turak">Aladon, Turak</A>, p. 45
      (30)&mdash;Commander of the Seanchan invasion force that landed at
      Falme.  He was killed there when <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> and
      <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A> led the heroes of
      the Horn of Valere against his army.  He was a Blademaster, and was
      quite stunned when <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> was able to match him.
      He also kept a collection of rare <I>cuendillar</I> objects, including
      (thanks in part to looting <A Href="#Bayle">Bayle Domon</A>'s ship) two
      seals on the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>'s prison.
  <Li><A Class="name">Aldieb</A>, p. 358
      (317)&mdash;<A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>'s white mare.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alijha">Alijha</A>, p. 416 (371)&mdash;An Aielman
      who is with <A Href="#Lewin">Lewin</A> in <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s
      fourth step through the columns of Rhuidean.
      He is nearly identical in appearance to <A Href="#Charlin">Charlin</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alnora">Alnora</A>, p. 424 (379)&mdash;A
      woman who <A Href="#Jonai">Jonai</A> wishes were alive to interpret
      dreams and possibly predict which action he should take.  She had glossy
      black hair.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alric">Alric</A>, p. 767 (693)&mdash;Warder bonded
      to <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> for almost twenty years (i.e.,
      almost since she was raised to the shawl).  He never complained when her
      position as <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A> kept him in the Tower,
      never complained when that position required her to be out of his
      immediate presence for long periods of time.  He was murdered by
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A> and her supporters when they deposed Siuan.
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Siuan">Sanche, Siuan</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alsera">Alsera</A>, p. 815 (737)&mdash;Wife of
      <A Href="#Bruan">Bruan</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alteima">Alteima</A>, p. 105 (85)&mdash;Wife of
      <A Href="#Tedosian">High Lord Tedosian</A>.
      <A Href="#Thom">Thom</A> forges a note about a relationship between her
      and <A Href="#Carleon">High Lord Carleon</A>; it is unknown whether this
      relationship actually exists, or whether Thom was just trying to make
      two of the High Lords fight each other instead of
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alwhin">Alwhin</A>, p. 46 (31)&mdash;Sharp-faced,
      blue-eyed Seanchan woman with a &ldquo;perpetual glower.&rdquo;
      The left side of her head is shaven,
      the other side long and brown-haired.
      She is a <I>sul'dam</I>, and has been raised to a Voice of the Blood.
      No other <I>sul'dam</I> has ever been raised to the Blood before,
      much less to a Voice of the Blood,
      but Alwhin knows too much to be a simple <I>sul'dam</I>:

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Perrin">Aybara, Perrin</A>, p. 38 (17)&mdash;A
      young man from Emond's Field.  He is <I>ta'veren</I>.  When he and
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> got separated from the rest of the group
      while fleeing the Trollocs on Winternight, Perrin met a man named
      <A Href="#Elyas">Elyas Machera</A>.  Elyas, a former Warder who found he
      could talk to wolves, helped Perrin discover the same ability in himself.
      Perrin's eyes are now yellow, just like the wolves' eyes, and he can
      enter what he calls the Wolf Dream (known to most as
      <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>, the World of Dreams) with them.
      Perrin is a childhood friend of fellow <I>ta'veren</I>
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> and <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A>.
      On the way to Tear, Perrin encountered a young woman by the name of
      <A Href="#Zarine">Zarine Bashere</A>, a Hunter for the Horn who
      took the name of <A Href="#Faile">Faile</A> (which means
      &ldquo;Falcon&rdquo; in the Old Tongue) as a more appropriate name for
      a hunter for the horn.
      The two have grown to love each other.
      Perrin is a very large man&mdash;he was always a big person,
      which caused him to be very cautious since he found as a child that he
      could easily hurt other children if his temper got out of hand.
      His size helped considerably when helping
      <A Href="#Haral">Master Luhhan</A> on his forge, but sometimes gives

      of the Forsaken.  He was the first of the Forsaken to be
      released from the sealing on the Bore.  He was trapped very close to the
      surface of the Bore, and thus not shielded very effectively from the
      passage of time; he emerged so deformed by age that he had to hide his
      face behind a cloth and was unable to speak.  He was killed by the
      Green Man at the Eye of the World.

      <A Href="#Tenobia">Queen Tenobia</A> of Saldaea; and her uncle.  He is

      that <A Href="#Zarine">Zarine Bashere</A> of Saldaea assumed

      and even more surprised that Rand was the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon
      Reborn</A>.  When she found
      this information out, Moiraine forbade her to leave them, since if she
      did she could upset the balance of the world by telling the wrong person
      that the <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A> was Reborn.  Faile eventually
      developed feelings for Perrin, feelings which he found he returned.

      she will be hurt sometime in the future (although she cannot say when).
      Sheriam has long been a symbol of the Tower, at least in the eyes of
      those who come to study there&mdash;she keeps a strict but not brutal
      discipline and makes sure that her students know their place around her.
      Her study is famous in the Tower, both as a place of sanctuary when the
      stress of novice (or Accepted) life becomes too great to bear alone and
      as a place of punishment when an initiate steps out of line.

      He is determined to find <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A>, the man

      Dain has a hatred for those who killed his father, and like most of the
      Whitecloaks he is convinced that it was Aes Sedai who beat them at
      Falme (i.e., the Seanchan are just a story engineered by Darkfriends to

      from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which
      he carried with him for a long time.  He was separated from the dagger
      by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory
      sequence, gaps which he desperately wants to fill.  Mat's
      <I>ta'veren</I> qualities manifest themselves particularly well with
      random events, such as dice games&mdash;he almost never loses a toss of

      His country, Malkier, was overrun by Trollocs shortly after he was born,

      Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan's emotional walls and break them
      down without him even knowing they were there.  He loves her very much,
      whether he admits it openly or not, and Nynaeve, to her surprise (and
      Lan's), loves him in return.  His favorite colors on women are green,
      blue, and white&mdash;Nynaeve's wardrobe just happened to become rich in
      those colors once she found out.

      the Dark One was imprisoned by the Creator at Shayol Ghul.
      This prison kept the Dark One from touching the world until it was bored
      into by humans during the Age of Legends.  This hole, called the Bore,
      allowed the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new
      outbreaks of war, treachery, violence, and crime.  The attempt to free
      the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the
      War of Power by some), during which a number of important leaders
      forsook the Light and gave their lives to the Dark One; these people
      are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of the most powerful Aes
      Sedai of the Age of Legends.  The War of the Shadow did not end until
      <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A>, the

      Shayol Ghul and re-sealed the Dark One back into his prison.
      At the moment of sealing, Shai'tan lashed out at those sealing the
      prison, driving them insane and tainting <I>saidin</I> itself,
      the male half of the True Source, dooming all male Aes Sedai to insanity
      as well and starting the Time of Madness.  These seals are weakening
      now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the Dark One is once

      He was perhaps the greatest man who ever lived, and the most powerful
      Aes Sedai in recorded history.  During the War of the Shadow, he lead
      the forces of the Light against the Forsaken, and led the final stroke
      which re-sealed the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A> back into his prison.
      Unfortunately, during this stroke he was driven insane by the Dark One's
      touch, eventually killing his wife, his children, and everyone he loved,
      as well as anyone who carried a drop of his blood.  For this act, people
      remember him with a new name:  <A Href="#Kinslayer">Kinslayer</A>.
      After he had done this, <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A> gave him his

      mountain to form on the spot where he stood.  This mountain is called
      Dragonmount, and is near the present-day city of Tar Valon.  It is
      unfortunate that the name of one of the greatest men to ever live is now
      synonymous with evil, for Lews Therin killed his kin due to the Dark
      One's influence, but without Lews Therin there may not have been a world

      She did not, however, send Elayne on the mission she gave the other two
      so as not to anger Morgase any more than she already had.
      Elayne still chose, of her own volition, to accompany her friends on
      their dangerous mission:  spring the obvious trap the Black Ajah had set
      for them, and see if they can catch them in the process.
      Elayne is currently in the Stone of Tear, following the aftermath of the

      <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A>.  He will become First Prince of the Sword
      when his sister becomes Queen.  He is in Tar Valon training with the
      Warders, as all sons of Andoran queens must do.  Gawyn has feelings for
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A>, and she returns them, but he
      refuses to even express his interests since Galad has a crush on Egwene
      as well.  His sign is a white boar.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Morgase">Trakand, Morgase</A>, p. 22 (9)&mdash;By
      the Grace of the Light, Queen of Andor, Defender of the
      Realm, Protector of the People, High Seat of House Trakand.  Mother to
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> and <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>.  She was
      trained in the White Tower, as all Queens of Andor have, but was too
      weak in the One Power to do anything worthwhile with the knowledge she
      learned there.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Valda">Valda, Eamon</A>, p. 30 (17)&mdash;Lord
      Captain of the Children of the Light stationed near Tar Valon.
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A> believes that Valda will not march on the city
      unless <A Href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</A> gives him the order, and Niall
      will not march unless he thinks the Aes Sedai are vulnerable.
      Valda is <A Href="#Dain">Dain Bornhald</A>'s superior; Dain's father
      worried that his son would blindly follow Valda's orders.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Vandes">Vandes, Eban</A>, p. 79 (61)&mdash;Man who
      wrote <I>The History of the Stone of Tear</I>,
      a book <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> read while in his room in the Stone.
      It told him of the twisted doorway which led to the world of the
      Aelfinn, the people who answer three questions.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Willim">Willim</A>, p. 424 (379)&mdash;A
      man from <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s sixth step through the columns of
      Rhuidean who was sent away from the Aiel clan because he found he could
      channel <I>saidin</I>.  He was <A Href="#Jonai">Jonai</A>'s son.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Bethamin">Zeami, Bethamin</A>, p. 638 (575)&mdash;A
      <I>sul'dam</I> who was left behind after the battle at Falme, now
      captured by <A Href="#Egeanin">Egeanin</A>.  When Egeanin found her, she
      tried to get away, so Egeanin snapped the <I>a'dam</I> she was carrying
      around her neck, hoping to use it as one more barrier to the woman
      fleeing (since Bethamin supposedly cannot channel, the <I>a'dam</I>
      should have no other effect than throwing a metal ring around her head).
      Much to Egeanin's and Bethamin's surprise, the <I>a'dam</I> held
      Bethamin just as well as it held the <I>damane</I> it was intended for.
      From this, and from <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>'s and
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>'s information about the possibility of
      learning to channel (not just having it inborn), Egeanin reasoned that
      all <I>sul'dam</I>, including Bethamin, could channel if they were
      taught&mdash;which went against everything she had been taught her
      entire life.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Asne">Zeramene, Asne</A>, p. 632 (570)&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Black Ajah with dark, tilted eyes and a bold nose.
      She grew up in Saldaea.  She was of the Green Ajah (openly, at least)
      before leaving with <A Href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</A>; she regrets
      leaving her Warders behind when she left the Tower.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Zorelle">Zorelle</A>, p. 435 (389)&mdash;Aes Sedai
      that <A Href="#Nalla">Nalla</A> serves in
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s ninth step through the columns of Rhuidean.
      <A Href="#Charn">Charn</A> would serve her as well if he married Nalla.
