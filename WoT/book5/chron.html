      the War of the Shadow.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Rand">al'Thor,

      9&mdash;Translator of a fragment of the Prophecies of the Dragon who lived
      circa 400 A.B. (After the Breaking).  She was First Maid and Swordfast
      to <A Href="#Raidhen">Raidhen of Hol Cuchone</A>.

<Img Src="../chapters/snakewheel.gif" Alt="chapter icon" Width="96" Height="97">
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Elaida">Elaida do Avriny
      a'Roihan</A>, p. 13&mdash;Aes Sedai formerly of the Red Ajah, now
      raised to the <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>.  She led the coup that
      deposed <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> and <A Href="#Leane">Leane
      Sharif</A>.  Elaida was the advisor to <A Href="#Morgase">Queen
      Morgase</A> of Andor prior to her dismissal after
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>'s dissappearance.  She sometimes has the
      Foretelling; in fact, one of her first Foretellings concerned the
      importance of the Royal Family of Andor in the fight against the Shadow.
      She had this Foretelling during the time after
      <A Href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</A> disappeared and threw Andor into its
      third war of Succession&mdash;Elaida attached herself to Morgase as soon
      as it became apparent that she would be the one who would take the
      Throne.  However, since there was really no definite royal family at the
      time, the Foretelling could have concerned the previous royal family,
      that of <A Href="#Mordrellen">Mordrellen</A>,
      <A Href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</A>,
      and <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail</A>.  Since two of these three have
      already had a major impact on the Pattern of the Age, it is likely that
      Elaida was not completely correct in her interpretation of her
      Foretelling.  Elaida is very strong in the One Power&mdash;only Siuan
      (before she was stilled),
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>, <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>,
      Elayne, <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>, and a few others are stronger.
      As a Red, Elaida is suspicious of all sisters of the Brown, Green,
      and Yellow Ajahs, and <I>hates</I> members of the Blue.  She does not
      believe she will be able to trust a Blue ever again.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>; <A Href="#Alviarin">Freidhen,
      Alviarin</A>; <A Href="#Siuan">Sanche, Siuan</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>, p.
      13&mdash;Leader of the Aes Sedai, their equivalent of a King or Queen.
      She in theory holds supreme power amongst the sisters, and leads the Hall
      of the Tower at its meetings.  Kings and queens of nations strong and
      weak will come if summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their
      entire trip figuring out how they will put a knife in her back while
      there.  The Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the
      Power and in her character.  The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be
      unanimous, as must the vote to depose one.  Once chosen, the Amyrlin is
      said to be &quot;of all Ajahs and none&quot;&mdash;all previous
      affiliations with Ajah are ignored (at least in theory).  The Ajahs get
      fairly equal numbers of Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two
      exceptions:  no Amyrlin has been raised from the Red Ajah since
      <A Href="#Bonwhin">Bonwhin</A>, who was deposed and stilled for nearly
      breaking the Tower in <A Href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</A>'s day,
      except for <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida a'Roihan</A>, the current Amyrlin
      Seat in Tar Valon; the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of
      Amyrlins from its Ajah&mdash;four of the last five Amyrlins (not counting
      Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah.  These two exceptions to the mean
      number of Amyrlins from one's Ajah have only added to the friction
      between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years.  The Amyrlin has a
      secretary of sorts, the <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A>,
      who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the Amyrlin was
      raised from.  The office was held by <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>,
      raised from the Blue Ajah, until she was deposed for her involvement with
      events surrounding the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  Her
      successor was the leader of the coup, <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny
      a'Roihan</A>, raised from the Red Ajah.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Elaida">a'Roihan, Elaida do Avriny</A>;
      <A Href="#Aryman">Aryman, Deane</A>; <A Href="#Bonwhin">Meraighdin,
      Bonwhin</A>; <A Href="#Siuan">Sanche, Siuan</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Danelle">Danelle</A>, p.
      14 (13)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Brown Ajah, the only Brown sister among
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>'s group of followers and advisors that
      deposed <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A>.  She is the typical Brown, often
      slight and seemingly lost in her own thoughts.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</A>, p. 14&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the White Ajah, but secretly of the Black.  Typical
      of most Whites, she has a very cool, collected personality.  She serves
      as <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A> under
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>, despite being of a different Ajah than
      Elaida was raised from.  Elaida was all but forced to choose Alviarin in
      order to gain the support of the White Ajah when bringing charges against
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A>.  Without Alviarin as Keeper, the White Ajah
      would most likely have been divided over whether to depose Siuan, and
      only the Red would be behind Elaida.  This would most likely lead to the
      stilling of Elaida and possibly even the dismantling of the Red Ajah.
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Elaida">a'Roihan, Elaida do Avriny</A>;
      <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Keeper">Keeper of the
      Chronicles</A>, p. 14&mdash;Essentially the secretary to the
      <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>.  The Keeper is traditionally chosen
      from the same Ajah the Amyrlin was raised from, and wears a stole of the
      color of her Ajah instead of the striped stole of the Amyrlin.  The post
      was held by <A Href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</A> of the Blue Ajah until a
      coup deposed <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> and stilled both Siuan and
      Leane.  Her successor was <A Href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</A> of
      the White Ajah, despite the fact that Siuan's successor was from the Red.
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>;
      <A Href="#Alviarin">Freidhen, Alviarin</A>; <A Href="#Gitara">Moroso,
      Gitara</A>; <A Href="#Leane">Sharif, Leane</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Teslyn">Teslyn Baradon</A>, p. 14&mdash;Aes Sedai
      of the Red Ajah with bony fingers.  She is a close second
      to <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A> in severity.  One of four Reds among
      Elaida's advisors.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Taim">Mazrim Taim</A>, p. 14&mdash;False Dragon
      who wreaked havoc in Saldaea before being captured by
      Aes Sedai.  He later escaped his captors, possibly with Black Ajah
      assistance.  It is believed that <A Href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</A>
      may have dispatched his army to look for Taim.  Taim is very strong in
      the One Power, almost as strong as <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Tenobia">Tenobia si Bashere Kazadi</A>, p.
      14&mdash;Queen of Saldaea, niece of
      <A Href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</A>, and cousin of
      <A Href="#Faile">Faile</A>.  <A Href="#Alviarin">Alviarin</A> thinks
      that the fact that her army is moving is a sign that she does not trust
      the Aes Sedai to deal with the escaped false Dragon
      <A Href="#Taim">Mazrim Taim</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Bashere">Davram t'Ghaline Bashere</A>, p.
      14&mdash;Lord of Bashere, Tyr, and Sidonia; Guardian of the
      Blightborder; Defender of the Heartland; Marshal-General to
      <A Href="#Tenobia">Queen Tenobia</A> of Saldaea; and her uncle.  He is
      also <A Href="#Faile">Faile</A>'s father.  He is one of the best
      military commanders in the World, in such company as
      <A Href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</A>, <A Href="#Agelmar">Agelmar Jagad</A>,
      <A Href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</A>, and
      <A Href="#Rodel">Rodel Ituralde</A>.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Faile">t'Aybara, Faile</A>;
      <A Href="#Deira">t'Bashere, Deira</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Joline">Joline Maza</A>, p. 15 (14)&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Green Ajah.  She is fond of revealing, clinging dresses.
      She is the only Green among those who deposed <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan
      Sanche</A>, who now advise <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Shemerin">Shemerin</A>, p. 15 (14)&mdash;Aes Sedai
      of the Yellow Ajah, the only Yellow among those who deposed
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> and now advise
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>.  Slightly plump and fluttery, she never
      managed the outward calm displayed by most Aes Sedai.  She was the one
      who told <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> the Yellow Ajah signal.
      <!-- Elaida later ordered her reduced to Accepted, despite the fact that
      Tower law forbade her to do so. -->
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Javindhra">Javindhra Doraille</A>, p. 15&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Red Ajah.  She has smooth cheeks but a hard face and
      harsh voice.  She is a Sitter for the Red Ajah.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Memara">Memara</A>, p. 16 (15)&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Red Ajah.  Alviarin suggests her as an advisor to
      <A Href="#Tenobia">Queen Tenobia</A> during the crisis with
      <A Href="#Taim">Mazrim Taim</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Niall">Pedron Niall</A>, p. 16 (15)&mdash;Lord
      Captain Commander of the Children of the Light, highest officer
      among the Children.  He is one of the great military commanders in the
      world, in company with <A Href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</A>,
      <A Href="#Agelmar">Agelmar Jagad</A>, <A Href="#Rodel">Rodel
      Ituralde</A>, and <A Href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</A>.  He is trying to
      get Altara and Murandy to cede land to Illian so the Council of Nine
      will not invade both countries.  He is also trying to expand Amadicia's
      borders into parts of Ghealdan.  His headquarters is in Amadicia, and he
      rules there even above <A Href="#Ailron">King Ailron</A>, although this
      is not spoken of openly.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Valda">Valda,
      Eamon</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Evanellein">Evanellein</A>, p. 16 (15)&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Gray Ajah.  She is very concerned with her
      appearance, at least for a Gray.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Amathera">Amathera Aelfdene Casmir Lounault</A>,
      p. 16 (15)&mdash;The Panarch of Tarabon.  She has vanished, allegedly at
      Aes Sedai hands, according to <A Href="#Evanellein">Evanellein</A>.  In
      reality, Amathera was being held prisoner by sisters of the Black Ajah
      under <A Href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</A>, and was rescued by
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> and <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>.  They
      had her keep a low profile for several days so as not to be hurt by the
      mob outside the Panarch's Palace (since it is not all that far from
      &ldquo;The Panarch is dead!&rdquo; to &ldquo;Death to the
      Panarch!&rdquot;), then she returned to her position.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Elayne">Elayne Trakand</A>, p. 18 (16)&mdash;The
      Daughter-Heir to the Throne of Andor, daughter of
      <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A>, and <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail
      Damodred</A>, sister of <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A> and half-sister to
      <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A>.  Now one of the Accepted.  Her sign is a
      golden lily.  She has blonde, curly hair.  She lived next door to
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A> as a novice, and the two are very
      good friends.  She is currently travelling with fellow Accepted
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</A> and two escorts sent to watch
      the two of them, <A Href="#Thom">Thom Merrilin</A> and
      <A Href="#Juilin">Juilin Sandar</A>.  Elayne is one of three women who
      is destined to fall in love with <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, the
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>, according to a viewing that
      <A Href="#Min">Min Farshaw</A> told her about.  The other two women are
      Min herself and <A Href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</A>.  Elayne is not crazy
      about the notion of &quot;sharing&quot; Rand, but it would appear she
      does not have much choice.  <I>See also</I>

      <A Href="#Gawyn">Trakand, Gawyn</A>;
      <A Href="#Morgase">Trakand, Morgase</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Andaya">Andaya Forae</A>, p. 18 (16)&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Gray Ajah.  A thin, birdlike woman, she is outwardly timid
      despite Aes Sedai agelessness.  This makes her seem unlikely to be a
      good mediator, but she is in fact one of the best of them.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Galad">Galadedrid (Galad)
      Damodred</A>, p. 18 (16)&mdash;Son of <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A>'s
      late husband <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</A> and his first
      wife <A Href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</A>.  He is half-brother to
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> and <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>.  Stunningly
      handsome, even <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> has trouble blushing when
      she speaks to him, and Aes Sedai will often forsake their work to watch
      him practice (shirtless) in the sword yard.  Galad has much skill with
      the sword, and has acheived Blademaster status in practice if not in
      name.  He disappeared from Tar Valon during the violence that
      accompanied <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A>'s deposition and joined
      <A Href="#Valda">Eamon Valda</A>'s band of the Children of the Light.
      Because of his sword skill, Galad was promoted to an official position
      very quickly, and now controls his own small band of men.  He says he
      became a Whitecloak because it &quot;felt right.&quot;  He is extremely
      virtuous, and will do whatever he thinks is right regardless of who it
      hurts, even himself.  His sign is a winged silver sword, point down.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Morgase">Morgase Trakand</A>, p. 18 (16)&mdash;By
      the Grace of the Light, Queen of Andor, Defender of the Realm,
      Protector of the People, High Seat of House Trakand.  She is the
      mother of <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> and <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>.
      She married <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</A>, a prince of
      Cairhien, Elayne and Gawyn's father; he died when they were young.  She
      has since gone through several lovers, including
      <A Href="#Thom">Thomdril Merrilin</A>, a former court-bard;
      <A Href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</A>, her First Prince of the Sword and
      Captain of the Guards; and most recently <A Href="#Gaebril">Lord
      Gaebril</A>, a man who led the faction that stilled the riots in Caemlyn
      that sprang up on Morgase's trip to Tar Valon to inquire about Elayne's
      whereabouts.  Thom was exiled from the city of Caemlyn when he started
      telling her what he really thought of some of her plans, her
      relationship with Bryne ebbed away until finally Gaebril told her to
      exile him too, and Gaebril seems to be usurping her power.  The
      Daughter-Heir of Andor is traditionally trained by Aes Sedai in the
      White Tower, and Morgase underwent novice training to keep the tradition
      alive.  She was given the gift of a Great Serpent ring despite not being
      Accepted, and still wears it on her left hand.  She was previously
      advised by <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</A> of the Red
      Ajah, who is now the <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="DH">Daughter-Heir</A> (of Andor), p. 18
      (16)&mdash;By Andoran tradition, the oldest daughter of the Queen
      succeeds her on the Lion Throne.  No man is allowed to be King, at least
      not as more than a figurehead.  The previous Daughter-Heir,
      <A Href="#Tigraine">Tigraine</A>, disappeared over twenty years
      ago; the current Daughter-Heir is <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</A>.
      It is also traditional for the Daughter-Heir and her oldest brother
      (who will become First Prince of the Sword when she becomes Queen) to
      train in Tar Valon, but Elayne is the first Daughter Heir, indeed, the
      first ruler of any kind in recent memory, to actually have enough
      ability to channel that she will become Aes Sedai.  The position of
      Daughter-Heir is somewhat in jeopardy at present:  Tar Valon has lost
      track of Elayne, the Queen of Andor has fled the country and is presumed
      dead by her citizens, and Elayne has no daughters to be her heirs if she
      does take the throne.  <I>See also</I>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Gaebril">Gaebril</A>, p. 18 (17)&mdash;Advisor
      to Queen Morgase of Andor, and her latest love interest. She seems
      completely besotted with him, at least to the outside observer.  Gaebril
      arrived in Caemlyn just as riots sprang up throughout the city, and he
      joined and led one of the factions.  His faction restored order in the
      city, and upon Morgase's return from Tar Valon, he gave her her kingdom
      in one piece, as it was when she left.  Allegedly, she was so happy that
      he had done this that she sent <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>, her
      Aes Sedai advisor, away and made Gaebril her advisor.  However, during
      <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>'s trip through Caemlyn to deliver
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>'s letter, he overheard Gaebril ordering
      someone to kill Elayne and anyone else with her&mdash;he tried to find a
      way to report this information to Morgase, but ended up telling Elayne
      when he found out it was Gaebril whom he had overheard.  Gaebril is
      actually <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A>, one of the Forsaken.  He has been
      Compelling Morgase to obey him, though he has noticed that she is less
      pliable than he expected&mdash;as if her mind seeks a way out of the
      Compulsion despite not knowing it is trapped.  <I>See also</I>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Gawyn">Gawyn Trakand</A>, p. 19 (17)&mdash;Son of
      <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A> of Andor and brother to
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>.  He will become First Prince of the Sword
      when Elayne becomes Queen.  He and his half-brother
      <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A> went to train with the Warders in the White
      Tower, as all sons of Andoran queens have for centuries, and both now
      possess considerable skill with the sword.  During the chaos that
      erupted after <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>'s deposition, Gawyn
      formed a band of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders
      except Galad, who are called the Younglings.  The Younglings fought back
      against their teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and
      <A Href="#Leane">Leane</A> from their imprisonment.  Gawyn himself
      killed <A Href="#Hammar">Hammar</A> and <A Href="#Coulin">Coulin</A>,
      the men in charge of teaching the sword and for his personal training,
      respectively, both of which are Blademasters&mdash;few Warders are as
      good as they were, and Gawyn managed to kill both of them.  Gawyn did
      not know which party to support&mdash;he believes that anyone who
      opposes Tower Law by trying to free Siuan and Leane is wrong, but at the
      same time he does not know all the facts surrounding the change in
      leadership.  In fact, his sister Elayne and her friends
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</A> and
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A> side with those
      who broke from the Tower.  This is especially difficult since Gawyn has
      feelings for Egwene, feelings which she returns.  However, he is afraid
      to speak up because Galad has similar feelings.
      His sign is a white boar.

      attempted to destroy the Aes Sedai stronghold&mdash;he nearly succeeded.
      Bonwhin was stripped of stole and staff and stilled for nearly destroying
      the Tower, and since then no Amyrlin from her Ajah has been raised.  She
      was succeeded by <A Href="#Aryman">Deane Aryman</A> of the Blue Ajah,
      who attempted to undo the damage Bonwhin did to the Tower's reputation,
      and succeeded for the most part.  Unfortunately, this created extreme
      tension between the Red and Blue Ajahs that still exists today, and is
      the main reason why the Red Ajah will (and did) take any pretext to pull
      down an Amyrlin raised from the Blue Ajah.  <I>See also</I>

      children, and everyone he loved, as well as anyone who carried a drop of
      his blood.  For this act, people remember him with a new name:
      <A Href="#Kinslayer">Kinslayer</A>.  After he had done this,
      <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A> gave him his sanity back long enough for
      him to realize what he had done; Lews Therin killed himself by drawing on
      <I>saidin</I> too heavily, causing a mountain to form on the spot where
      he stood.  This mountain is called Dragonmount, and is near the
      present-day city of Tar Valon.  It is unfortunate that the name of one of
      the greatest men to ever live is now synonymous with evil, for Lews
      Therin killed his family due to the Dark One's influence, but without
      Lews Therin there may not have been a world left in which to kill them.
      Lews Therin's voice sometimes speaks inside <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s
      head, offering advice or sobbing over lost women, but is getting more and
      more vocal.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Rand">al'Thor, Rand</A>;

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Min">Elmindreda (Min) Farshaw</A>,
      p. 40 (32)&mdash;A young woman from Baerlon.  She has a special ability
      that few besides herself know about:  she sees images and auras around
      people, especially around Aes Sedai and Warders, that foretell their
      futures.  Min does not always know what these viewings mean, but when
      she does, it <I>will</I> happen; it is only a question of how and when.
      Min was fascinated by the number of images she saw around
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>, especially the one she saw that included
      herself:  three different women are destined to fall in love with him,
      one of which is herself.  She usually dresses in attire reserved for men;
      this habit was picked up when growing up with her father, who was a
      miner.  She worked in the Tower so <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>
      could have her and her viewings close by; she eventually helped Siuan
      and <A Href="#Leane">Leane</A> get free from their cell as well.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Nem">Admer Nem</A>, p. 40 (32)&mdash;Man
      whose barn <A Href="#Min">Min</A>, <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A>,
      <A Href="#Leane">Leane</A>, and <A Href="#Logain">Logain</A> slept in on
      their journey through the countryside.  He found them, and in the chaos
      his lantern fell into the hay and the barn burned to the ground.  Nem
      would just as soon have hanged them, had the local lord,
      <A Href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</A>, not shown up at that moment.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Logain">Logain Ablar</A>, p. 40 (32)&mdash;False
      <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A> who created war in Ghealdan and
      surrounding nations before being captured and gentled by the Red Ajah.
      He got loose during the chaos surrounding the deposing of
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>, and eventually was escorted out of
      Tar Valon by Siuan and her traveling companions.  Before he was gentled
      he was of considerable strength, and attracted quite a following of loyal
      soldiers.  <A Href="#Min">Min</A> still has viewings of him with a halo
      over his head, which she thinks indicates that he will become a figure of
      great power sometime in the future.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>, p. 40 (32)&mdash;Born in
      Tear to a fisherman, she was sent to the White Tower on the
      first boat to leave after she discovered she had the ability to channel
      inborn.  She was novice friends with <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine
      Damodred</A>, and was present at <A Href="#Gitara">Gitara Moroso</A>'s
      Foretelling of the Rebirth of the <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>.  After
      being raised to the shawl, she joined the Blue Ajah, and eventually came
      to lead the Blues' network of eyes-and-ears (i.e., spies) before being
      raised to the <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>.  She was only thirty
      years old when raised to the Amyrlin Seat, making her the youngest
      Amyrlin ever.  When her lifelong connection to the
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> was discovered, she and her
      <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A>, <A Href="#Leane">Leane
      Sharif</A>, were deposed and stilled by a group of sisters loyal to
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida a'Roihan</A>.  Siuan hopes to regain some of
      her previous standing in the new Tower that has separated from
      Elaida&mdash;her knowledge of the Blue Ajah spy network is hard to
      match, and she knows much that she thinks would be of use.

      from Arad Doman with coppery skin.  Just as her family members were
      training her in the seductive ways of Domani women, Leane found that
      her life would take a different direction:  she could channel
      <I>saidar</I>, and would do so with or without teaching.  She became an
      Aes Sedai, a member of the Blue Ajah, and was eventually raised to
      <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A> under
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>.  During the coup led by
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida a'Roihan</A> and <A Href="#Alviarin">Alviarin
      Freidhen</A> that deposed Siuan, Leane was thrown in the dungeon and
      stilled.  Leane has turned to her seductive side to try to replace what
      she lost in stilling; she is out of practice, but does well enough.

      First Prince of the Sword and Captain of the Queen's Guards
      under <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A> in Andor.  He was appointed
      to the position because Morgase had no living male relatives, but was
      exiled from Caemlyn on a suggestion from Morgase's new advisor,
      <A Href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</A>.  He now lives on his private estates

      unintentionally burned a barn: <A Href="#Mara">Mara Tomanes</A>,
      <A Href="#Amaena">Amaena</A>, and <A Href="#Serenla">Serenla</A>.  When

      war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight.  He fought
      Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status.  He was

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A>, p. 89 (65)&mdash;A
      young woman from Emond's Field, now one of the Accepted.  She has
      considerable potential with the One Power, and will most likely be one
      of the strongest Aes Sedai in over a thousand years.  It is also thought
      that she may be the first Dreamer in the Tower in almost 500 years; she
      is currently in training with the Wise Ones to learn more of this Talent.
      Egwene is good friends with <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</A>, the
      Daughter-Heir of Andor, and is also a childhood friend of
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, the Dragon Reborn.  In fact, Rand and
      Egwene were all but Promised in their youth, but both of them feels an
      almost sibling-like love for each other now; they know that they cannot
      get married, and don't really want to.  Egwene is the love object of both
      of Elayne's brothers, <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A> and
      <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>&mdash;she is flattered by Galad's attentions,

      He came into the Waste with <A Href="#Kadere">Hadnan Kadere</A>'s

      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> dares not reveal even a hint of his true

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Mat">Matrim (Mat) Cauthon</A>, p. 98 (71)&mdash;A
      young man from Emond's Field.  He is <I>ta'veren</I>.  Along with his
      good friends, <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> and
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A>, he left home to escape the Trolloc
      attack on Winternight.  On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger
      from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which
      he carried with him for a long time.  He was separated from the dagger
      by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory
      sequence.  These gaps were filled and more when he passed through the
      twisted door to the land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three
      requests:  a foxhead medallion that protected him from women's
      channeling, a way out of the land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of
      past lifetimes that were the gaps in his memory.  Mat's <I>ta'veren</I>
      qualities manifest themselves particularly well with random events, such
      as dice games&mdash;he almost never loses a toss of the dice, even if
      the dice are weighted.  He has found that battles are the ultimate form
      of gambling, and along with his newfound memories he can win almost
      every battle he fights quite decisively.  He has four sisters, including
      <A Href="#Eldrin">Eldrin</A> and <A Href="#Bode">Bodewhin</A>, who are 16
      and 17, respectively.  His father <A Href="#Abell">Abell</A> is one of
      the best archers in the Two Rivers, possibly in the World.  Mat has
      gotten in the habit of carrying concealed knives under his clothes in
      case he is attacked&mdash;his collection would surprise anyone.  In the
      Waste, he met a woman named <A Href="#Melindhra">Melindhra</A>, a Maiden
      of the Spear from the Shaido Clan.  However, she is not the
      <A Href="#9Moons">Daughter of the Nine Moons</A>, who Mat is destined to
      marry according to the Aelfinn.  He has a scar along his neck from where
      the Eelfinn tried to kill him; this was also in accordance with
      what the Aelfinn told him, that he is
      &ldquo;to die and live again.&rdquo;
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</A>, p. 98 (71)&mdash;A
      young woman from Emond's Field, formerly its Wisdom, now one of
      the Accepted.  She has exceptional potential in the One Power, and will
      most likely be the most powerful Aes Sedai since the Age of Legends.
      However, Nynaeve's channeling is obstructed due to the fact that she had
      to learn to control her ability herself without really knowing what she
      was controlling; she is a wilder.  She can only touch the True Source
      when she is extremely angry.  She went, along with
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> and <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>, to Tear
      to hunt down <A Href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</A> and the rest of the sisters
      that left the Tower and declared themselves Black Ajah.  On the way she
      freed <A Href="#Amathera">Amathera</A> from them, as well as defeating
      <A Href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</A>.  Moghedien got free, and now hunts
      Nynaeve with a passion for revenge.  Nynaeve has strong feelings for
      <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>, feelings which he returns; she can hardly wait
      for the time when <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> releases him from his
      bond so she can have him to herself.  She wants to become Aes Sedai for
      the sole purpose of Healing people; she thinks the Tower meddles in the
      affairs of others far too much, but she does need it to learn the skills
      necessary to help others.  She is determined to find a way to Heal
      everything short of death&mdash;she will not be convinced that anything
      short of that cannot be Healed, including stilling, gentling, and the
      wound on <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s side.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Ilyena">Ilyena Therin Moerelle</A>, p. 98
      (71)&mdash;Wife of <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A> during the

      color to <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> and
      <A Href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</A>.  According to the memories of Lews

      could talk to wolves, helped Perrin discover the same ability in himself.
      Perrin's eyes are now yellow, just like the wolves' eyes, and he can
      enter what he calls the Wolf Dream (known to most as

      was Red Ajah before turning to the Black, but her oath to the Black was

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Toma">Toma dur Ahmid</A>, p. (685)&mdash;Person
      who devised the Toman Calendar, which was adopted approximately two
      hundred years after the death of the last male Aes Sedai and continued
      until the Trolloc Wars.  The Calendar recorded years After the Breaking,
      or AB.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Tiam">Tiam of Gazar</A>, p. (685)&mdash;Person who
      proposed the Gazaran Calendar, which celebrated the alleged freedom from
      the Trolloc threat by recording Free Years (FY).  This calendar was
      adopted due to the chaos the resulted during the Trolloc Wars and the
      resulting confusion as to which year it actually was under the Toman
      Calendar.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Uren">Uren din Jubai Soaring Gull</A>, p.
      (685)&mdash;Sea Folk scholar and deviser of the
      <A Href="#Farede">Farede</A> Calendar, which measured dates from the
      arbitrarily set end of the War of the Hundred Years as years of the
      New Era (NE).  This calendar is currently in use.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Farede">Farede</A>, p. (685)&mdash;Panarch of
      Tarabon near the end of the War of the Hundred Years.
      She was responsible for promulgating the calendar that now bears her
      name, which measures years of the New Era (NE), the first of which
      marked the (arbitrary) end of the War.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Lian">Lian</A>, p. (688)&mdash;Mother-sister
      to <A Href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</A>, sister-wife to
      <A Href="#Amys">Amys</A>, wife of <A Href="#Rhuarc">Rhuarc</A>.
      She is the roofmistress of Cold Rocks Hold.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Dark">Shai'tan</A>, p. (690)&mdash;The 
      Dark One, source of all evil, complete
      opposite of the <A Href="#Creator">Creator</A> in every way.  At
      the moment of Creation, the Dark One was imprisoned by the Creator at
      Shayol Ghul.  This prison kept the Dark One from touching the world until
      it was bored into by humans during the Age of Legends.  This hole, called
      the Bore, allowed the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new
      outbreaks of war, treachery, violence, and crime.  The attempt to free
      the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the War
      of Power by some, especially those on the Shadow's side), during which a
      number of important leaders forsook the Light and gave their lives to the
      Dark One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of
      the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  The War of the Shadow
      did not end until <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A>, the Dragon,
      and his Hundred Companions Traveled to Shayol Ghul and re-sealed the Dark
      One back into his prison.  At the moment of sealing, Shai'tan lashed out
      at those sealing the prison, driving them insane and tainting
      <I>saidin</I> itself, the male half of the True Source, dooming all male
      Aes Sedai to madness as well and starting the Time of Madness.  These
      seals are weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the
      Dark One is once again able to exert influence on the world.  Only three
      of them still hold, as far as is known, and despite being made of
      <I>cuendillar</I>, they would break by a fall from a table.

      Forsaken.  He was the second one to be released from the
      sealing on the Bore.  He was trapped close to the surface of the Bore,
      so he was not shielded from the passing of time very effectively; he
      emerged as a <Em>very</Em> old man, so old that his face was so wrinkled
      one could barely make out his features anymore.  He was killed by
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> at the Eye of the World.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Balthamel">Balthamel</A>, p. (692)&mdash;One
      of the Forsaken.  He was the first of the Forsaken to be
      released from the sealing on the Bore.  He was trapped very close to the

      passage of time; he emerged so deformed by age that he had to hide his
      face behind a cloth and was unable to speak.  He was killed by the
      Green Man at the Eye of the World.

      the man who will take the Sea Folk from the sea.
      Since these prophecies are almost
      identical in most parts to the Prophecies of the
