  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>, p. 9
      (ix)&mdash;According to the <I>Karaethon Cycle</I>, the Prophecies of the
      Dragon, the man who is the Rebirth of <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin
      Telamon</A>, the man known as the <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A> during the
      War of the Shadow.  Over the years, many men have claimed to be the
      Dragon Reborn, even men who could not channel.  The true Dragon has been
      Reborn in a young man named <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, a shepherd
      from Emond's Field.  <I>See also</I>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Elaida">Elaida do Avriny
      a'Roihan</A>, p. 13 (1)&mdash;Aes Sedai formerly of the Red Ajah,
      now raised to the <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>.  She was born the
      youngest daughter of a minor House in the north of Murandy.  She served
      as advisor to <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A> of Andor for her
      entire reign, and led the coup that deposed <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan
      Sanche</A> and placed her on the Amyrlin Seat in Siuan's place.  She
      distrusts anyone not of her Ajah (as most Reds do), and doesn't believe
      she will ever trust any member of the Blue Ajah again, even in the
      slightest.  Her <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A> is
      <A Href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</A> of the White Ajah&mdash;she was all
      but forced to choose Alviarin due to her role in the
      deposition of Siuan.  If she chose a Keeper from her Ajah, she most
      likely would not have won the support of the White Ajah, and then
      <I>she</I> would have been stilled and banished from the Tower instead
      of Siuan.  She sometimes has the Foretelling, but not all that often or
      that strongly.  One of her Foretellings was that the Royal Family of
      Andor would play a crucial role in the Last Battle&mdash;this Foretelling
      occurred around the time the Succession was going on, so she immediately
      attached herself to Morgase as soon as it became clear that she would be
      the one to take the Lion Throne.  Another was to predict that
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> would shake the world on its very
      foundations&mdash;she constantly kicks herself for not doing something about
      him when he was in front of her, little more than a farmboy at the time.
      Her most recent Foretelling was that &quot;the White Tower would be
      whole again, except for remnants cast out and scorned, whole and
      stronger than ever.  <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> will face the
      Amyrlin Seat and know her anger.  The Black Tower will be rent in blood
      and fire, and sisters will walk its grounds.&quot;  The Foretelling
      about Rand is obviously deadly accurate.  However, the one about the
      Royal Family occurred at an inopportune time; at the time of Elaida's
      Foretelling, the Royal Family was not certain.  It may have meant
      Morgase, <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>, <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A>, and
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> (they have all had a large role to play in
      the recent past), but it is also possible it could have meant the old
      Royal Family, that of Tigraine, Taringail, Galad, and later Elayne and
      Gawyn as well.  After all, Morgase is just Morgase, but Tigraine is the
      mother of the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  Her most recent
      Foretelling will of course be fulfilled, but not necessarily how she
      wants it to be; she does not realize that the Amyrlin Seat in the
      Foretelling might not be her, that the remnants cast out might be those
      loyal to her, and that the destruction of the Black Tower might have
      nothing to do with her.  Elaida is quite strong in the
      One Power; only Siuan, <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>,
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>, <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A>,
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>, and a few others can match her strength.
      Elaida has always sought positions of power; she chose to follow Morgase
      to have a better chance at guiding the forces in the Last Battle, and
      tried to capture Rand al'Thor in an effort to gain similar control.  The
      only sisters that support her are those that are actually Black Ajah and
      those that would follow any Amyrlin legally raised, as Elaida was
      (although just barely; all laws used to raise her were stretched almost
      to their breaking point, and some believe they actually did shatter).
      Elaida is currently building a palace for herself atop the Warders' old
      practice yard.  The building will be about as tall as the White Tower.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Dark">Dark One</A>, p. 13
      (1)&mdash;Name, used in every land, for Shai'tan, the source of all evil,
      complete opposite of the <A Href="#Creator">Creator</A> in every way.  At
      the moment of Creation, the Dark One was imprisoned by the Creator at
      Shayol Ghul.  This prison kept the Dark One from touching the world until
      it was bored into by humans during the Age of Legends.  This hole, called
      the Bore, allowed the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new
      outbreaks of war, treachery, violence, and crime.  The attempt to free
      the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the War
      of Power by some, especially those on the Shadow's side), during which a
      number of important leaders forsook the Light and gave their lives to the
      Dark One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of
      the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends.  The War of the Shadow
      did not end until <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A>, the
      <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>, and his Hundred Companions Traveled to
      Shayol Ghul and re-sealed the Dark One back into his prison, trapping the
      Forsaken with him.  At the moment of sealing, Shai'tan lashed out at those
      sealing the prison, driving them insane and tainting <I>saidin</I> itself,
      the male half of the True Source, dooming all male Aes Sedai to madness
      as well and starting the Time of Madness.  These seals are weakening now,
      enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the Dark One is once again able
      to exert influence on the world.  These seals were scattered throughout
      the world by Aes Sedai during the Breaking of the World.  In order of
      when they were found, they were placed:  1) At the Eye of the World
      (broken when it was found); 2) in the hands of Bayle Domon, later
      pilfered by High Lord Turak of the
      Seanchan (broken at the battle of Falme), 3) On Seanchan, part of High
      Lord Turak's collection (broken at the battle at Falme); 4) In the Great
      Hold at the Stone of Tear (still intact); 5) In the Panarch's Palace in
      Tanchico (broken enroute to Salidar); 6) One in Rhuidean (still intact),
      and 7) Found by <A Href="#Taim">Mazrim Taim</A> on a small farm in
      Saldaea (still intact).  Despite being made of <I>cuendillar</I>, the
      three that remain unbroken can be cut with a knife and would break by a
      fall from a table.  The Dark One is also referred to by other euphemisms,
      including Sightblinder, Lord of the Grave, Father of Lies, Grassburner,
      Leafblighter, Heartsbane, Soulsbane, Lord of the Twilight, Father of
      Storms, Shepherd of the Night, and (among Darkfriends) the Great Lord of
      the Dark.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>, p. 13
      (2)&mdash;Leader of the Aes Sedai, their equivalent of a King or Queen.
      She in theory holds supreme power amongst the sisters, and leads the Hall
      of the Tower at its meetings.  Kings and queens of nations strong and
      weak will come if summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their
      entire trip figuring out how they will put a knife in her back while
      there.  The Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the
      Power and in her character.  The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be
      unanimous, as must the vote to depose one.  Once chosen the Amyrlin is
      said to be "of all Ajahs and none"&mdash;all previous affiliations with Ajah
      are ignored (at least in theory).  The Ajahs have gotten fairly equal
      numbers of Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions:  no
      Amyrlin has been raised from the Red Ajah since
      Bonwhin Meraighdin, who was
      deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in
      <A Href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</A>'s day, except for
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</A>, the
      current Amyrlin Seat in Tar Valon; the Blue Ajah has had more than the
      average number of Amyrlins from its Ajah&mdash;four of the last the last five
      Amyrlins (before Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah.  These two
      exceptions to the mean number of Amyrlins from one's Ajah have only added
      to the friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years.  The
      Amyrlin has a secretary of sorts, the <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the
      Chronicles</A>, who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the
      Amyrlin was raised from.  The office was held by <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan
      Sanche</A>, raised from the Blue Ajah, until she was deposed for her
      involvement with events surrounding the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon
      Reborn</A>.  Her successor was the leader of the coup,
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</A>, raised from the Red
      Ajah.  Siuan's deposition divided the Tower, and the faction opposing
      Elaida raised a new Amyrlin who could not be accused of choosing sides on
      the day Siuan was deposed:  <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A>, who was
      outside the Tower and not even a full sister from the time Siuan was
      deposed to the time she was Raised.  <I>See also</I>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Lerman">Lerman</A>, p. 14
      (2)&mdash;Chief mason for <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>'s palace.  He stared in
      disbelief when Elaida told him her palace was to have a spire ten spans
      higher than the Tower itself.  However, being that it is Elaida he is
      dealing with, he will have to find a way....
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Cemaile">Cemaile Sorenthaine</A>,
      p. 15 (3)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Gray Ajah, later raised to the
      <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>.  She was raised about three hundred
      years ago.  In memory of the days before the Trolloc Wars when no ruler
      held a throne without the White Tower's approval, she had a gilded clock
      commissioned.  The clock was taken down and forgotten in storage after
      she died, and it didn't reappear until <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A> put
      it back up when she was raised.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Galina">Galina Casban</A>, p. 16
      (5)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Red Ajah.  She has actually been of the Black Ajah
      for all but five of her almost ninety years wearing the shawl; she is of
      high standing among the Black sisters.  She is now the head of the Red
      Ajah, and led the expedition to bring <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> to Tar
      Valon after he was shielded.  She was captured by the Shaido after the
      battle at Dumai's Wells.  Galina has long black hair without a touch of
      gray in it.  She claims to have helped break two
      <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin</A>'s as a Black sister.  One
      (<A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>) was deposed and
      stilled, and the other was made to appear that she'd died in her sleep.
      She led the circle that stilled Siuan.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, p. 16
      (5)&mdash;A young man from Emond's Field in the Two Rivers, now proclaimed
      to be the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  He is very tall, with
      curly red-blond hair.  He was raised by Tam al'Thor
      and his wife Kari (until her death around the time
      Rand was five) in Emond's Field.  His real parents, however, were
      Janduin, the chief of the Taardad Aiel who
      brought the four clans across the Dragonwall to punish Laman's Sin, and
      a Maiden of the Spear named Shaiel, who was actually
      Tigraine Damodred, the runaway Daughter-Heir of Andor.  Tigraine gave
      birth to Rand on the slopes of Dragonmount, in accordance with prophecy;
      &quot;born of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the Old.&quot;
      Rand has a heron branded into each of his palms, which he received from
      the sword Tam gave him while fighting <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A>.
      He also has two dragons on his forearms, which he recieved in Rhuidean
      to designate him
      as the <I><A Href="#Caracarn">Car'a'carn</A></I>, the Chief of Chiefs of
      the Aiel.  He is not only the Dragon Reborn, but also <A Href="#Dawn">He
      Who Comes With the Dawn</A>, the man prophecied to reunite the Aiel, and
      the <A Href="#Coramoor">Coramoor</A>, the one prophecied to bring the Sea
      Folk out of the Sea.  He can channel strongly, more so than any person
      who ever lived (except the previous user of his soul,
      <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A>, who was obviously of equal
      strength), and is also <I>ta'veren</I>, the most strongly so since Lews
      Therin as well.  Lews Therin's voice has somehow found a new place inside
      of Rand's head; he talks to him in a mad voice when Rand least expects
      it, sometimes offering sound advice or knowledge, sometimes babbling,
      sometimes even trying to wrest control of <I>saidin</I> from him.
      Unlike Lews Therin, Rand is accompanied by two other
      <I>ta'veren</I> during this turing of the Wheel, two men born within days
      (hours, even) of him named <A Href="#Mat">Matrim Cauthon</A> and
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A>, who both grew up in Emond's Field as
      well.  Rand is destined to fall in love with three women (and has):
      <A Href="#Min">Min Farshaw</A>, <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne Trakand</A>, and
      <A Href="#Aviendha">Aviendha</A>.  Rand has had success in fighting many
      of the Forsaken; all to confront him have died or been trapped.  He
      killed <A Href="#Aginor">Aginor</A> at the Eye of
      the World after the <A Href="../book1/alphalast.html#Green">Green Man</A>
      killed <A Href="#Balthamel">Balthamel</A>; he
      allowed <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> to kill
      <A Href="#Belal">Be'lal</A> in the Stone of Tear, and killed
      <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A> in the Stone shortly afterward; in the
      wagons near the Spine of the World, <A Href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</A>
      confronted him and was pushed into the land of the Eelfinn by Moiraine;
      he killed <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A> in <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I> when he
      came to the Royal Palace in Caemlyn; and
      <A Href="#Asmodean">Asmodean</A>, his teacher, was killed shorlty after
      Rahvin met his fate.  His prophecies fulfilled grow:  he has already been
      born on the slopes of Dragonmount of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but
      raised by the old, taken the Stone of Tear and drawn <I>Callandor</I>,
      and began conquering "under the forgotten symbol," that of the Aes Sedai
      of the Age of Legends.  He is working on having the "spotless tower"
      break and bend knee to him (several Aes Sedai have sworn fealty to him
      and only him).  He is the salvation of the entire world, and as the
      prophecy states, he <I>will</I> save the world&mdash;and Break it again.

      during the War of the Shadow.  His rebirth, the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon
      Reborn</A>, is now alive and fulfilling all of the prophecies set to

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</A>, p.
      17 (6)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the White Ajah, but secretly the head of the Black
      Ajah.  She was chosen to head the Black Ajah after the previous leader
      was killed by <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A> after she managed to kill
      off the <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A> without Ishamael's approval.
      Typical of most Whites, she has a very cool, collected personality.
      She serves as <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the
      Chronicles</A> under <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>, despite being of a
      different Ajah than Elaida was raised from.  Elaida was all but forced to
      choose Alviarin in order to gain the support of the White Ajah when
      bringing charges against <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A>; unknown to
      Elaida, this also brought her the support of the Black Ajah.  Without
      Alviarin as Keeper, the White Ajah would most likely have been divided
      over whether to depose Siuan, and only the Red would be behind Elaida,
      which would most likely have led to the stilling of Elaida and possibly
      even the dismantling of the Red Ajah.  It still may, since Elaida is
      rapidly losing her power to Alviarin&mdash;and if Alviarin's loyalties are
      ever revealed, nothing will save either of them.

      <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Keeper">Keeper of the
      Chronicles</A>, p. 17 (6)&mdash;Essentially the secretary to the
      <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>.  The Keeper is traditionally chosen
      from the same Ajah the Amyrlin was raised from, and wears a stole of the
      color of her Ajah instead of the striped stole of the Amyrlin.  The post
      was held by <A Href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</A> of the Blue Ajah until a
      coup deposed <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> and stilled both Siuan and
      Leane.  Her successor was <A Href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</A> of
      the White Ajah, despite the fact that Siuan's successor was from the Red.
      The Keeper for the Aes Sedai who fled the Tower when
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A> was raised Amyrlin now have a Keeper of the
      Chronicles of their own, <A Href="#Sheriam">Sheriam Bayanar</A> of the
      Blue Ajah.  In theory, the Keeper of the Chronicles serves the Amyrlin
      and speaks for the Amyrlin; she is all but separate from her Ajah,
      although less so than the Amyrlin Seat herself.  However, both of the
      current Keepers have tried to expand their powers over the Amyrlin they
      serve, although for vastly different reasons&mdash;Alviarin is essentially
      trying to weaken Elaida and have herself or another Black sister raised
      in her place after Elaida is deposed; Sheriam tries to overstep
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> because she has a hard time thinking of
      Egwene being anything more than the frightened novice that came to her
      study not so long ago.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Sheriam">Bayanar,

      appointed after one of the Green's sitters left for Salidar.
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A> asked her to resign her position after only
      weeks and sent her to Ebou Dar to meet with <A Href="#Tylin">Queen

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>, p. 18
      (8)&mdash;Born in Tear to a fisherman, she was sent to the White Tower on the
      first boat to leave after she discovered she had the ability to channel
      inborn, according to Tairen law.  As a novice, she was good friends with
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine Damodred</A>, and was present at
      Gitara Moroso's Foretelling of the Rebirth of the
      <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>.  After being raised to the shawl, she
      joined the Blue Ajah to dedicate her life to finding and guiding the
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>, and eventually came
      to lead the Blues' network of eyes-and-ears (i.e. spies) before being
      raised to the <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>.  She was only thirty
      years old when raised to the Amyrlin Seat, making her the youngest
      Amyrlin to date.  She was also one of the strongest Amyrlins in recent
      history, and one of the most feared among the rulers of nations.  Her
      blue-eyed stare was feared by all.  When her twenty-year connection to
      the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> was discovered, she and her
      <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A>, <A Href="#Leane">Leane
      Sharif</A>, were deposed and stilled by a group of sisters loyal to
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida a'Roihan</A>.  Siuan hoped to regain some of her
      previous standing in the new Tower that separated from Elaida&mdash;her
      knowledge of the Blue Ajah spy network is hard to match, and she knows
      much that she thinks would be of use.  In one of her viewings,
      <A Href="#Min">Min</A> saw that Siuan would have to remain close by to
      <A Href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</A>&mdash;if she did not, both of them would
      die.  Siuan did not initially know what she meant, but now realizes that
      she is growing to love the gray-haired man who leads the Salidar army.
      She had a Warder named <A Href="#Alric">Alric</A>, but he died when
      she was deposed.  After coming to Salidar, <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>
      discovered how to restore Siuan's ability to channel, at least partially.
      This resurrected a part of her bond with Alric, but did not bring back
      her former strength, or her binding by the Oath Rod.  She can now lie as
      well as any child.  She now serves as an &ldquo;advisor&rdquo; to the
      new Amyrlin in Salidar, <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A>, but though
      she puts on a
      fa&ccedil;ade of hating the work, she is actually one of Egwene's
      foremost agents.  The fact that she is Aes Sedai, not to mention one who
      was stilled and Healed again, makes other sisters tend to be oblivious to
      this fact.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Alric">Alric</A>;

      is one of the strongest Aes Sedai in a thousand years or more,
      possibly since the Age of Legends, with the exception of

      18 (8)&mdash;A young woman from Emond's Field, now an Aes Sedai of the Yellow
      Ajah.  She was the Wisdom of her village, the youngest such ever chosen
      in Emond's Field.  She left when four of her villagers were taken away
      from the Two Rivers by <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> and
      <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>.  While the group traveled away from her home and
      toward her new life, Nynaeve made several discoveries:  she could channel
      the One Power, and had already done so without really knowing what she
      was doing; she developed feelings for al'Lan Mandragoran, Moiraine's
      Warder and the uncrowned king of the now dead nation Malkier; and she has
      a major role to play, as all of her younger friends in the group do, in
      the years to come.  She is very strong in the One Power; only a select
      few who were alive during the Age of Legends could match her.  When she
      arrived in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a
      novice, despite not being able to even <I>sense</I> the True Source
      unless angry, a result of her having to learn some minimal control of her
      ability without teaching.  She was sent on a false mission by
      <A Href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</A> on which she was almost leashed by the
      Seanchan as <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> was.  After she returned to the
      Tower, <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> sent her on a mission to hunt
      down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in
      Tanchico, she encountered <A Href="#Moghedien">Moghedien</A> and managed
      to better her in a duel of the Power.  Moghedien escaped, but two
      encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her,
      leashing her with an <I>a'dam</I> in <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>.  Nynaeve took
      Moghedien with her to seek out <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> and
      <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A> while they were fighting each other, and at
      the last moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin to
      ash with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could draw
      to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain control of
      himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire.  Nynaeve then kept Moghedien
      under control with a modified <I>a'dam</I> in Salidar.  Nynaeve wished
      to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she thinks the Tower
      meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and wants no part of it.
      She is determined to Heal anything short of death, and has already
      managed to Heal gentling.  Nynaeve felt bad when Moiraine died, because
      her first thought was not of her, but that now Lan was free from their
      bond.  She was not told that Lan's bond had been passed to
      <A Href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</A> the moment of Moiraine's death.

      Her kingdom is small, and she only rules a portion of it; the rest is
      governed by nobles who are not necessarily loyal to her.  She is the
      second from her House to sit on the throne&mdash;this is the maximum
      traditionally, and the only House to hold it for four generations fell
      so fast from power that it could not recover.  She is advised by

      says at one point that Galina "knew [her] Ajah long before [she] did,
      and took a personal interest in [her]."  This is just idle speculation,
      but I think it was the Black (not Red) Ajah that Galina knew she would
      choose.  It certainly fits with the idea of most Aes Sedai in the Tower
      being Black, and with Galina's personal interest in Tarna.  Again, it's

      Ajah.  He got loose during the chaos surrounding the deposing of
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>, and eventually was escorted out of
      Tar Valon by Siuan and her traveling companions.  Before he was gentled
      he was of considerable strength, and attracted quite a following of loyal
      soldiers.  <A Href="#Min">Min</A> still has viewings of him with a halo
      over his head, which she thinks indicates that he will become a figure of
      great power sometime in the future.  Recently, Logain has come forward
      with information that indicates the Red Ajah actually put him up to
      declaring himself the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>, most likely
      with the pretext that bringing down a false Dragon would bring more glory
      than gentling a simple man who could channel.  Logain was recently Healed
      by <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>, and was let free by

      High Seat of House Trakand.  Mother of <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> and
      <A Href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</A>.  She married <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail
      Damodred</A>, a prince of Cairhien, to further solidify her claim to the
      Throne of Andor and keep peace between the two nations; when
      Tigraine disappeared, Morgase made the best
      claim to succeed her, and married her widower to gain the support that
      would be gained by such action.  Taringail was Elayne's and Gawyn's
      father; he died when they were young.  Morgase
      has since gone through several lovers, including <A Href="#Thom">Thomdril
      Merrilin</A>, a former court-bard; <A Href="#Bryne">Gareth Bryne</A>, her
      First Prince of the Sword and Captain of the Guards; and most recently
      <A Href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</A>, a man who led the faction that
      stilled the riots in Caemlyn that sprang up on Morgase's trip to Tar
      Valon to inquire about Elayne's whereabouts.  Thom was exiled from the
      city of Caemlyn when he started telling her what he really thought of
      some of her plans, her relationship with Bryne ebbed away until finally
      Gaebril told her to exile him too, and Gaebril eventually chased Morgase
      herself out of the city when she found he was usurping her power.  The
      Daughter-Heir of Andor is traditionally trained by Aes Sedai in the White
      Tower, and Morgase underwent novice training to keep the tradition alive.
      She was given the gift of a Great Serpent ring despite not being Accepted,
      and still wears it on her left hand.  She was previously advised by
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</A> of the Red Ajah, who is
      now the <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A> in Tar Valon.  When Morgase
      discovered that Gaebril (who, unbeknownst to her, was actually
      <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A>) meant to usurp her throne, she left, and
      when she learned that the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> had taken
      over Caemlyn and none of her former supporters would give her aid, she
      fled to Amadicia to get help from the only place she thought she could:
      <A Href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</A> and the Children of the Light.  She is
      not aware that <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> only wants to give her country
      back to her, not to mention believes that she is dead.  If she made her
      presence known, she would no doubt have her country back in one piece
      and all would be well, but as royalty she believes she must work on her
      own and trust no one.  The entire world believes Morgase dead except for
      a select few, all of which are in Amadicia at the moment.  Her sign is
      three golden keys.

      in rural Andor, where he presided over the trial of three young women who
      unintentionally burned a barn: they turned out to be
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>, the former <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin
      Seat</A>; <A Href="#Leane">Leane Sharif</A>, the former
      <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the Chronicles</A>, and
      <A Href="#Min">Min Farshaw</A>.  When these three made an oath to serve
      him and then apparently broke it, he followed them out of sheer
      curiosity to Salidar.  Once their, he discovered the true identity of the
      three, as well as that the Tower was truly broken.  The Aes Sedai in
      Salidar persuaded him to command the army they would need to take the
      Amyrlin Seat from <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A>, since he was the only
      commander that the Warders thought would be willing and able to help
      them.  He is one of the six best military commanders west of the Aiel
      Waste, in a league with <A Href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</A>,
      Rodel Ituralde, <A Href="#Bashere">Davram
      Bashere</A>, Agelmar Jagad, and
      <A Href="#Mat">Matrim Cauthon</A>.  Although neither of them would admit
      it, Bryne seems to be developing feelings for Siuan Sanche; he wishes to
      avoid another mistake like his relationship as
      <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A>'s lover, and also never forgave Siuan for
      when she publicly shamed him years ago.  She seems to be developing
      similar feelings for him, much to her dismay.  He plans to be the first
      ever general to take the city of Tar Valon; the closest anyone else ever
      came was with <A Href="#Guaire">Guaire Amalasan</A>'s armies, who got as
      far as the White Tower itself, and <A Href="#Hawkwing">Artur
      Hawkwing</A>, who never managed to go beyond beseiging the city.
      Actually, Amalasan's troops never beseiged the city, they simply managed
      to breech the walls; Hawkwing never managed to stop the supply ships
      coming up the river.  Bryne believes he will be able to overcome this
      problem.

      of the World to ravage Cairhien.  Although almost every other clan
      despises the Shaido, all agree that even they deserved a real chief&mdash;they
      never got one.  Couladin died outside Cairhien while fighting
      <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A>&mdash;Mat killed him, but later remarked that

      then she should be the Keeper of the Chronicles.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Leane">Leane Sharif</A>, p. 40
      (37)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah.  She grew up in Arad Doman, and has
      coppery skin.  Just as her family members were training her in the
      seductive ways of Domani women, Leane found that her life would take a
      different direction:  she could channel <I>saidar</I>, and would do so
      with or without teaching.  She became an Aes Sedai, a member of the Blue
      Ajah, and was eventually raised to <A Href="#Keeper">Keeper of the
      Chronicles</A> under <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>.  During the coup
      led by <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida a'Roihan</A> and
      <A Href="#Alviarin">Alviarin Freidhen</A> that deposed Siuan, Leane was
      thrown in the dungeon and stilled.  Leane tried turning to her seductive
      side to try to replace what she lost in stilling; she was out of
      practice, but did well enough.  She eventually convinced the Aes Sedai
      in Salidar to let her stay with them and maintain the network of
      eyes-and-ears she kept in Tar Valon as Keeper.  She was later Healed by
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>, and restored to some of her former
      capacity for using the One Power.  The Hall of the Tower in Salidar
      decided that since she had been stilled, she was no longer Aes Sedai for
      that time and thus all of her titles and choice of Ajah were null and
      void.  Instead of petitioning to re-enter the Blue Ajah, she asked the
      Green Ajah if it would accept her; it did.  <I>See also</I>

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Mesaana">Mesaana</A>, p. 40 (37)&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  During the Age of Legends, Mesaana was told she was unfit to
      do research at the Collam Daan, but was capable of teaching others.  She
      spent her years teaching until the Bore was opened and she dedicated her
      life to the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>.  During the War of Power, she
      created &ldquo;schools&rdquo; for the children, at which she taught the
      children to spy on their parents and other such things.  After her
      release from the Bore, Mesaana set herself up in the White Tower, where
      she could control events without anyone suspecting she was behind them.
      She has been cooperating with <A Href="#Semirhage">Semirhage</A> to some
      extent.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Lanfear">Lanfear</A>, p. 40 (37)&mdash;One of the
      Forsaken.  Unlike the rest of the Forsaken, she chose her name for
      herself, which means &ldquo;Daughter of the Night&rdquo; in the Old
      Tongue.  She was born Mierin Eronaile, and was strong in the
      One Power.  She worked at the Collam Daan, the primary facility for
      research into the One Power.  Her final discovery there was what she
      thought was a new source for the One Power, one that could be harnessed
      by men and women alike&mdash;this source turned out to be the emissions
      through a thin spot in the Pattern from the <A Href="#Dark">Dark
      One</A>'s prison.  She and another Aes Sedai named Beidomon bored into
      the prison, creating what is now referred to as simply the Bore,
      allowing the Dark One to touch the world again and leading to the War of
      the Shadow.  Around this time, Mierin formed a relationship with
      <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A>, who headed the forces of the
      Light against the Shadow and was the most powerful man she had found.
      Lews Therin broke off the relationship when he found that she only
      wanted him for his power and authority and the possibility of power for
      herself through him.  Mierin never let go of him, and when he later met
      and married <A Href="#Ilyena">Ilyena Moerelle</A>, she tried to disrupt
      the wedding ceremony as well as split the two apart by any means.
      Eventually she went to Shayol Ghul to dedicate her soul to the Shadow,
      most likely to finally get back at Lews Therin for leaving her.  She
      declared as her territory the World of Dreams, <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>,
      using it to ends now unknown.  She transferred her obsessive love intact
      to Lews Therin's soul's new body, <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>,
      after being freed from the Bore.  She first appeared to him as a young
      woman named Selene, but disguised her appearance as a slightly less
      beautiful (but still stunning) woman.  Almost a year later, Lanfear
      found that Rand had been &ldquo;unfaithful&rdquo; to her, and she tried
      to kill him.  Before she could, she was pushed through the twisted stone
      doorway <I>ter'angreal</I> leading to the lands of the Eelfinn by
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>, becoming trapped.  It is not known
      whether Lanfear is still alive.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Graendal">Graendal</A>, p. 40
      (37)&mdash;One of the Forsaken.  A fleshy woman with curled red-gold hair.
      Before the War of the Shadow, she became the leading authority on
      diseases of the brain, and spent much of her life dealing with the
      insane, schizophrenic, and others well beyond the touch of Healing.  She
      was the best at subtle manipulations of the human mind that ever lived.
      After the Bore was drilled, she went through a change after she realized
      the world could never live up to her standards.  So she began dressing in
      the very way she once mocked, with low cut dresses that clung to her and
      left little to the imagination.  After being released from the Bore,
      Graendal took up residence in Arad Doman, capturing several members of
      the Royal Family to use as servants.  All of her servants are not only
      physically well shaped and good-looking, but also had power in their
      society before she captured them.  She includes in her collection the
      sister of the Domani king, two rulers from Shara, and other important
      figures.  She has been working with <A Href="#Sammael">Sammael</A> in the
      recent past.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Belal">Be'lal</A>, p. 40 (37)&mdash;One
      of the Forsaken.  After being released from the Bore, he took up
      residence in Tear as the High Lord Samon.  He was killed by
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> in the Stone of Tear, just before
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> took <I>Callandor</I>.  He had white hair at his
      temples, and was a Blademaster.  Since he was destroyed by balefire, he
      is completely dead&mdash;not even the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A> himself can
      bring him back.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Ishamael">Ishamael</A>, p. 40
      (38)&mdash;One of the Forsaken.  He was the most powerful of the Forsaken, and
      during the Age of Legends he was a prominent philosopher and theologian
      named Elan Morin Tedronai.  He was never really bound inside the Bore,
      and led the hidden forces of the Shadow for the three thousand odd years
      from the end of the War of the Shadow to the present.  He took credit for
      such things as convincing the then insane <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin
      Telamon</A> to kill everyone he loved, pursuading the dying
      <A Href="#Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</A> not to accept the Aes Sedai
      Healing that might have saved his life, sending the Trollocs out of the
      Great Blight during the Trolloc Wars, and many other events in history
      that turned out poorly.  When the rest of the Forsaken were freed,
      Ishamael kept them away from eachother's throats.  He confronted
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> at the Eye of the World where he was severed
      from the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>'s bonds; he confronted him again at
      Falme where Rand put his sword through him and melted it, but not
      after Ishamael gave Rand a wound that he has not been able to recover from
      yet; and he confronted Rand in the Stone of Tear after he took
      <I>Callandor</I>.  Rand killed Ishamael after beating him sore by
      plunging <I>Callandor</I> into his heart.  His body rotted quickly, but
      it was proof that Ba'alzamon, which he called himself
      to the public, was a human being, and not the <A Href="#Dark">Dark
      One</A>.  However, death is not always final with the Dark One; with the
      appearance of two other Foraken presumed dead, it is likely that
      Ishamael has been resurrected as well.  <I>See also</I>

      the Forsaken.  During the Age of Legends, she was one of the best
      Healers ever known.  She was called to all corners of the world Heal
      people that others thought beyond help.  However, she was sadistic; she
      exacted a price in the form of pain from her subjects in return for her
      Healing services.  Most thought the pain or anguish she exacted from
      them was a small price to pay for being alive, but eventually the Hall
      of Servants found out about her practices and gave her the choice of
      being severed or bound with the Power, never again to know her
      &ldquo;pleasures.&rdquo;  She chose instead to pledge for the
      <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>, and created one of the most oppressive and
      pain-filled areas of Shadow control during the entire War of Power.
      After being freed from the Bore, Semirhage went in service to the Dark
      One by extracting information from captured Borderlanders and Aes Sedai.
      She also sent the Trollocs to the Stone of Tear to battle those that

      and from the first day proceeded to almost equal Lews
      Therin's accomplishments, almost equal Lews Therin's strength, and almost
      equal him but never surpass him in everything.  He became one of the
      Light's greatest generals, once again second in command under Lews
      Therin.  Demandred believed that he was Lews Therin's intellectual and
      military superior, and was furious when Lews Therin was chosen to lead the
      Light's forces over him during the War of the Shadow.  He developed a
      burning hatred of Lews Therin, and finally dedicated his life to the
      Shadow so he could finally better Lews Therin&mdash;he believed the Shadow
      would eventually win the war since Lews Therin was commanding the Light's
      armies, and that if he, Barid Bel Medar, had been chosen to command them,
      the Light would have prevailed.  When Demandred was freed from the Bore,
      he transferred his hatred of Lews Therin to the new recipient of his soul,
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>.  Demandred was recently told by the

      Niall recently offered a treaty with <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A>
      of Andor, offering Whitecloak assistance to retake her throne in exchange
      for Whitecloak presence in Caemlyn and elsewhere in Andor, a presence
      that Morgase had not allowed even a fraction of during her reign.  Niall
      was killed by his alleged Spymaster, <A Href="#Omerna">Abdel Omerna</A>,
      who claimed he had gone against everything the Children stood for by
      allowing Morgase to avoid being put to the question.  He was replaced by

      <A Href="#Galad">Galad</A> went to train with the Warders in the White
      Tower, as all sons of Andoran queens have for centuries, and both now
      possess considerable skill with the sword.  During the chaos that erupted
      after <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>'s deposition, Gawyn formed a band
      of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders except Galad, who
      are called the Younglings.  The Younglings fought back against their
      teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and <A Href="#Leane">Leane</A>
      from their imprisonment.  Gawyn himself killed Hammar and Coulin, the men
      in charge of teaching the sword and for his personal training,
      respectively, both of which were Blademasters&mdash;few Warders are as good as
      they were, and Gawyn managed to kill both of them.  With recent
      developments, Gawyn does not know which party to support&mdash;he believes
      that anyone who opposed Tower Law by trying to free Siuan and Leane was
      wrong, but at the same time he doesn't know all the facts surrounding the
      change in leadership.  In fact, his sister Elayne and her friends
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</A> and <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene
      al'Vere</A> side with those who broke from the Tower, and Egwene, the

      the sword, and has achieved Blademaster status in practice if not in
      name.  He disappeared from Tar Valon during the violence that accompanied
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A>'s deposition and joined <A Href="#Valda">Eamon
      Valda</A>'s band of the Children of the Light.  Because of his sword
      skill, Galad was promoted to an official position very quickly, and now
      controls his own small band of men.  He says he became a Whitecloak
      because it &ldquo;felt right.&rdquo;  He is extremely virtuous, and will do whatever
      he thinks is right regardless of who it hurts, even himself.  His sign
      is a winged silver sword, point down.  Galad has feelings for

      joined the Whitecloak army, Valda promoted him quickly because of his

      regardless of where he obtained it.  Valda thinks that
      <A Href="#Niall">Pedron Niall</A>'s time as Lord Captain Commander of the
      Children of the Light is coming to an end&mdash;his skill as a military
      commander earned him the right to have the position as long as he has,

      this habit was picked up when growing up with her father, who was a
      miner.  However, once she started to develop feelings for Rand, she began
      to wear more traditionally feminine attire.  Min was in Tar Valon helping

      When he and <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> got separated from the rest of
      the group while fleeing the Trollocs on Winternight, Perrin met a man
      named Elyas Machera.  Elyas, a former Warder who
      found he could talk to wolves, helped Perrin discover the same ability in
      himself.  Perrin's eyes are now yellow, just like the wolves' eyes, and
      he can enter what he calls the Wolf Dream (known to most as
      <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>, the World of Dreams) with them.  Perrin is a
      childhood friend of fellow <I>ta'veren</I>
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> and <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A>.  On
      the way to Tear, Perrin encountered a young woman by the name of
      Zarine Bashere, a Hunter for the Horn who took the name of
      <A Href="#Faile">Faile</A> (which means &ldquo;Falcon&rdquo; in the
      Old Tongue) as a more appropriate name for a Hunter for the Horn.  The
      two are now married.  Perrin is a very large man&mdash;he was
      always a big person, which caused him to be very cautious since he found
      as a child that he could easily hurt other children if his temper got
      out of hand.  His size helps considerably when helping
      <A Href="#Haral">Master Luhhan</A> on his forge, but sometimes gives
      others the impression that he is slow and stupid.  He returned to the Two
      Rivers for a time to repel the series of Trolloc attacks; he and his wife
      are recognized as Lord and Lady there, the first noblility of the Two
      Rivers since the Trolloc Wars.  Perrin was instrumental in freeing Rand
      from his entrapment at Dumai's Wells; the two had a fight afterwards
      (they had planned it as a way for Perrin to leave, although they most
      likely didn't plan on it being as violent as it was), and Perrin went to

      their oldest surviving offspring.  Her two older brothers were killed,
      and when Davram sent her younger brother off to fight while keeping her
      at home, she ran away and swore the oath of a Hunter of the Horn in
      Illian.  When she became a Hunter, she renounced her old name,
      Zarine, at first considering adopting the name
      &ldquo;Mandarb&rdquo;&mdash;she chose Faile
      when she found <A Href="#Mandarb">Mandarb</A> was the name of
      <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>'s horse.  She fell in love with
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A> while on her search for the Horn, who
      told her that the Horn had been found.  She was shocked, but even more
      so to find out that <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> was the
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> and that both he and Perrin are
      <I>ta'veren</I>.  Faile stayed near Perrin, and finally accompanied him
      to the Two Rivers where she helped fend off the Trolloc attacks; the two
      were married shortly afterwards.  They were then proclaimed Lord and
      Lady of the Two Rivers.  Perrin hated the idea, but Faile insisted they
      have a modest estate, and even servants, which she trained herself.  Her
      name means &ldquo;Falcon&rdquo; in the Old Tongue; she is the falcon in
      <A Href="#Min">Min</A>'s viewings of Perrin.  She is very protective of
      her husband, and does whatever she can to make sure he not so much as
      <I>looks</I> at another woman, even though he has no intention of doing
      so.  She is a very jealous wife, especially toward people like
      <A Href="#Berelain">Berelain</A> who eye her husband all the time.  She
      even cornered <A Href="#Min">Min</A> when they first came to Caemlyn and

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Nesune">Nesune Bihara</A>, p. 62
      (66)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Brown Ajah.  She is one of the Aes Sedai now sworn
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>.  She always listens to all sides before drawing
      any conclusions, and she remembers <I>everything</I>.  She is slender,
      and grew up in Kandor.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Erian">Erian Boroleos</A>, p. 62
      (66)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah.  She had four Warders until

      the battle at Dumai's Wells.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Katerine">Katerine Alruddin</A>, p.
      62 (66)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Red Ajah.  Though she keeps it secret, she is
      actually of the Black Ajah, and has been for twelve years.  She was
      captured by <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> during the battle at Dumai's Wells.
      If something happened to <A Href="#Galina">Galina</A>, the leader of the
      Aes Sedai after Rand was kidnapped, Katerine was to take over for her as
      the next strongest Red sister.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Coiren">Coiren Saeldain</A>, p. 62
      (66)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Gray Ajah.  She is plump and pompous, and led
      the embassy <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A> sent to <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>
      in Cairhien.  She was captured and shielded during the battle at Dumai's
      Wells.  She was designated to take over that group if something happened
      to both <A Href="#Galina">Galina</A> and
      <A Href="#Katerine">Katerine</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Sarene">Sarene Nemdahl</A>, p. 62 (66)&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the White Ajah.  She has a temper, but she will admit she is
      wrong if she is.  She taught novice classes on &ldquo;the nature of
      reality.&rdquo;  Her Warder is Vitalien.  She has a secret love of
      writing poetry&mdash;she would die of shame if Vitalien ever discovered
      that she compares him to a leopard and other graceful, powerful animals
      in her poems.  She was captured and shielded after the battle at Dumai's
      Wells.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Elza">Elza Penfell</A>, p. 62

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Mat">Matrim (Mat) Cauthon</A>, p.
      62 (66)&mdash;A young man from Emond's Field.  He is <I>ta'veren</I>.  Along
      with his good friends, <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> and
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A>, he left home to escape the Trolloc
      attacks after Winternight.  On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a
      dagger from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol,
      which he carried with him for a long time.  He was separated from the
      dagger by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory
      sequence.  These gaps were filled and more when he passed through the
      twisted door to the land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three
      requests:  a foxhead medallion that protects him from women's channeling,
      a way out of the land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes
      that were the gaps in his memory.  Mat's <I>ta'veren</I> qualities
      manifest themselves particularly well with random events, such as dice
      games&mdash;he almost never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are
      weighted.  He has found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling,
      and along with his newfound memories he can win almost every battle he
      fights quite decisively.  He has four sisters, including
      Eldrin and Bodewhin, who are 17 and 16, respectively.  His father
      <A Href="#Abell">Abell</A> is one of
      the best archers in the Two Rivers, possibly in the World.  Mat has
      gotten in the habit of carrying concealed knives under his clothes in
      case he is attacked&mdash;his collection would surprise anyone.  In the Waste,
      he met a woman named Melindhra, a Maiden of the Spear from the Shaido
      Clan.  However, she is not the <A Href="#9Moons">Daughter of the Nine
      Moons</A>, who Mat is destined to marry according to the Aelfinn;
      besides, she tried to kill him on orders from her master among the
      Darkfriends.  Mat had to kill her to save his own skin, but regrets it
      deeply.  He has a scar along his neck from where the Eelfinn tried to
      kill him&mdash;which was also in accordance with what the Aelfinn told him,
      that he is &quot;to die and live again.&quot;  He currently heads an
      army called the Band of the Red Hand, after the army of King Aemon of
      old Manetheren, and serves in a way as Rand's personal general&mdash;this
      works well, since Mat seems to be a better general than even
      <A Href="#Bashere">Davram Bashere</A>, who has earned
      his good reputation as one of the best commanders alive.  Mat does not
      trust any Aes Sedai, and because of this refuses to take his foxhead
      medallion off even to take a bath.  Mat is currently in Ebou Dar trying
      to keep an eye on <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> and
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> from getting themselves killed.  <I>See

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Jondyn">Jondyn Barran</A>, p. 63
      (67)&mdash;Gnarled old man from the Two Rivers.  He is a better bowshot than
      anyone in the Two Rivers except Tam al'Thor and
      possibly <A Href="#Abell">Abell Cauthon</A>, and he is the best hunter
      bar none.  He always says what he thinks, regardless of who hears.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Tam">Tamlin (Tam) al'Thor</A>, p. 63
      (67)&mdash;<A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s father.  He taught Rand about the
      Flame and the Void, a trick he uses to concentrate and to win archery
      competitions; Rand found that it is the way he can gain access to
      <I>saidin</I>.  Tam is not actually Rand's biological father; he found
      Rand as a newborn on the slopes of Dragonmount and took him home with
      him since Rand's mother was dead.  He was at Dragonmount as part of the
      Aiel War, which he left home to participate in when he was young.  He
      became an officer in the Illianer army, and even achieved Blademaster
      status, acquiring a heron-mark sword.  He married a woman from Caemlyn,
      <A Href="#Kari">Kari</A>, who he met while stationed there.  When the
      Aiel War started, he fought Aiel all the way to Tar Valon and the Battle
      of the Shining Walls, where he found Rand on the mountain.  Tam and Kari
      raised Rand as their own son.  Tam always won the archery competitions
      (or came in second to <A Href="#Abell">Abell Cauthon</A>), and passed
      his archery skills on to Rand.  He also taught <A Href="#Aram">Aram</A>
      how to use his sword.  It is not known if Tam knew that the child
      he was raising was the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.

      channel, and is of moderately high strength.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Kenly">Kenly Maerin</A>, p. 66
      (72)&mdash;A young man from the Two Rivers.  He is barely old enough to marry

      of <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Loial">Loial</A>, p. 67
      (73)&mdash;Son of <A Href="#Arent">Arent</A> son of
      <A Href="#Halan">Halan</A>, an Ogier from Stedding Shangtai.  He left the
      <I>stedding</I> at around age 90 to see the world; by Ogier standards, he
      is not yet old enough to leave the <I>stedding</I> without permission
      from the Council of Elders.  He is fond of books and history, and is an
      excellent Treesinger.  He is writing a book about his travels with the
      three <I>ta'veren</I> he meets, <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>,
      <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A>, and <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A>.
      Loial is constantly afraid that his mother will find him and try to marry
      him off and settle him down; however, he does like his mother's choice of
      wives for him, <A Href="#Erith">Erith</A>.  He, like most of the Ogier,
      is sad that most humans don't remember the Ogier, and is horrified that
      some even think he is a Trolloc on first seeing him.

      She has four Warders.  She was sent, along with
      <A Href="#Bera">Bera</A>, to establish diplomatic relations with
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> in the Aiel Waste; upon returning, she followed
      him to Dumai's Wells and was made to swear fealty to him.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Paitar">Paitar Nachiman</A>, p. 71

      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> back from Falme to Tar Valon.  Her Warder
      is named Tomas.  She is more interested in current
      events than the average Brown; most of them couldn't care less what
      happened now, only what happened years ago.  She gave Egwene the twisted
      stone ring <I>ter'angreal</I> to assist her in Dreaming, and also once
      told <A Href="#Morgase">Morgase</A> that there was really no need to keep
      her in the Tower until she learned to control her ability when she was a
      novice, since she wouldn't ever be able to do much with it anyway.  When
      Verin went to the Two Rivers with <A Href="#Alanna">Alanna</A>, they
      helped to fight the Trollocs that attacked, and when they left they
      brought a half-dozen young women with them who could channel, including
      <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>'s sister Bode.  When she and
      Alanna reached Caemlyn, they found that the Tower had been broken, and
      decided to side with the Salidar embassy when it reached town.  Verin is
      quite old&mdash;her hair is starting to turn gray, which to an Aes Sedai means
      she is quite old indeed.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alanna">Alanna Mosvani</A>, p. 71
      (79)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah.  She is dark and slender with black
      hair and dark eyes.  She has one surviving Warder,
      Ihvon; her other, Owein, died in the Two Rivers while scouting the
      Whitecloak camp.  She thinks that <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>,
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A>, and <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> should be
      bonded as Warders to &quot;keep an eye on them,&quot; but <I>says</I>,
      &quot;I am not so lost to custom yet as to bond a man against his will.
      Not quite yet.&quot;  This appears to have changed, however, since one
      of the first things she did after seeing Rand was to bond him.  She
      later found that bonding Rand was a grievious error; not only is it
      impossible to compel him in comparison to most Warders (she compared it
      to attempting to uproot an oak tree with her bare hands), but she
      constantly feels the pain he experiences from the wound in his side,
      perhaps even more severely than he feels it.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aviendha">Aviendha</A>, p. 139 (173)&mdash;Aiel
      of the Nine Valleys sept of the Taardad Aiel.  Formerly a Maiden of the
      Spear, she was forced to give up the spear to become a Wise One because
      she had the ability to channel inborn.  She has green eyes, and is of
      age with <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> and <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>.  She is
      more than pretty with dark, reddish hair.  Aviendha is one of the three
      women in <A Href="#Min">Min</A>'s viewing of Rand&mdash;she also saw
      that she was to fall in love with him when she went through the three
      rings in Rhuidean.  She denied her feelings for him at first, but when
      the wagons crossed the Dragonwall toward Cairhien, sweat tents became
      unavailable and she tried bathing as &ldquo;wetlanders&rdquo; did; Rand
      came in as she was standing before the bath in her skin, and she
      panicked.  She created a Traveling gateway to Seanchan (she does not
      remember how), trying to get as far away from Rand as possible, into the
      middle of winter.  When Rand rescued her, she decided she could not hide
      her feelings any longer, and the two ended up spending the night in
      eachother's arms before coming back.  Aviendha says a similar incident
      will not occur, and punishes any Maiden who makes a crack about it (how
      they found out about something that occurred on the far side of the
      world on another continent is a different subject entirely).  She felt

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</A>, p.
      140 (167)&mdash;The <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>, Breaker of the World.  He
      was perhaps the greatest man who ever lived, and the most powerful Aes
      Sedai in recorded history.  During the War of the Shadow, he led the
      forces of the Light against the Forsaken, and led the final stroke which
      re-sealed the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A> back into his prison.
      Unfortunately, during this stroke he was driven insane by the Dark One's
      touch, eventually killing his wife Ilyena, his
      children, and everyone he loved, as well as anyone who carried a drop of
      his blood.  For this act, people remember him with a new name:
      <A Href="#Kinslayer">Kinslayer</A>.  After he had done this,
      <A Href="#Ishamael">Ishamael</A> gave him his sanity back long enough for
      him to realize what he had done; Lews Therin killed himself by drawing on
      <I>saidin</I> too heavily, causing a mountain to form on the spot where
      he stood.  This mountain is called Dragonmount, and is near the
      present-day city of Tar Valon.  It is unfortunate that the name of one of
      the greatest men to ever live is now synonymous with evil, for Lews
      Therin killed his family due to the Dark One's influence, but without
      Lews Therin there may not have been a world left in which to kill them.
      Lews Therin's voice sometimes speaks inside <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>'s
      head, offering advice or sobbing over lost women, but is getting more and

      has a deep voice for a woman.  She is from Shienar.  Known to few, she is

      that the only Sitter that does as she asks is Black Ajah.

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Moghedien">Moghedien</A>, p. 161
      (195)&mdash;One of the Forsaken.  Her name means "Spider" in the Old Tongue.
      She always works from safety, attacks from safety, and will run unless
      she can do so.  She developed a command of <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I> that
      surpassed even <A Href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</A>'s mastery&mdash;in the real
      world, Lanfear was more powerful, but even she could not top Moghedien in
      the World of Dreams.  After being released from the Bore, Moghedien
      eventually found herself in Tanchico, in the Palace of the Panarch of
      Tarabon.  While there, she chanced upon <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve
      al'Meara</A>, who was trying to save the Panarch at the time and take the
      seal on the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A>'s prison from its hold in the
      Palace.  She and Nynaeve fought in a duel to the last, and Nynaeve managed
      to better Moghedien, much to the surprise of both of them.  She managed
      to escape Nynaeve's tied off shield, and on their next encounter, this
      one in <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I>, she ripped

      arguing over who to raise as <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin</A> years back,
      it was deadlocked over four candidates who had each worn the shawl about
      fifty years; the Hall wanted an Amyrlin that was younger than the eighty
      or more years than were common.  Seaine suggested <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan
      Sanche</A>, then a young Blue sister that had worn the shawl for ten
      years; she was eventually raised.  Later, Seaine was charged by

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Beonin">Beonin Marinye</A>, p. 163
      (197)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Gray Ajah.  She is pretty, has honey-colored
      hair, and grew up in Tarabon.  Her blue-gray eyes seem to constantly look
      startled.  Nothing seems to surprise her, though, and
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> thinks she would not believe the sun would
      come up unless she saw it herself, and if one morning it did not, she
      would just take it to confirm that she was correct to demand proof.  She
      is one of the six sisters in Salidar that have most of the authority,
      despite not being part of the Hall of the Tower.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Rahvin">Rahvin</A>, p. 166
      (201)&mdash;One of the Forsaken.  He was fond of using Compulsion, and was
      known for being a ladies' man&mdash;he always had a woman on his arm.  After
      being released from the Bore, he took up residence in Caemlyn as
      <A Href="#Gaebril">Lord Gaebril</A>, and used Compulsion to have
      <A Href="#Morgase">Queen Morgase</A> not only make him her advisor, but
      her lover as well.  He eventually planned to take over the country
      directly as the first ever King of Andor&mdash;he did his best to weaken
      support for Morgase, exiling her supporters and befriending those who
      opposed her, finally chasing her from the country as well.  Shortly after
      news of Morgase's death or at least abdication reached Cairhien, Rahvin
      was confronted and killed by <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A> in
      <I>Tel'aran'rhiod</I> with a weave of balefire strong enough to burn
      Rahvin's soul out of the pattern for days, possibly all the way back to

      (201)&mdash;One of the Forsaken.  During the Age of Legends, he was one of
      the foremost biologists of his time, specializing in genetics.  He went
      over to the Shadow because only there could he do all of the experiments
      he wanted to.  He was the one who created the Trollocs, Dragkhar,
      <I>gholam</I>, Darkhounds, and other Shadowspawn.  Some of the other
      Forsaken think he was insane, for only someone insane would create some
      of the creatures he did.  He was the second one to be released from
      the sealing on the Bore, after <A Href="#Balthamel">Balthamel</A>.
      He was trapped close to the surface of the Bore, so he was not shielded
      from the passing of time very effectively; he emerged as a very old man,
      so old that his face was wrinkled so that one could barely make out his
      features anymore.  He was killed by <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> at the Eye
      of the World.  Unbeknownst to almost everyone (including the Forsaken),
      Aginor has been reincarnated in the body of a Borderlander man.  He is
      now called Osan'gar.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Balthamel">Balthamel</A>, p. 166
      (201)&mdash;One of the Forsaken.  He was the first of the Forsaken to be
      released from the sealing.  He was trapped very close to the surface of
      the Bore, and thus not shielded very effectively from the passage of
      time; he emerged so deformed by age that he had to hide his face behind
      a cloth and unable to speak with his own tongue.  He was killed by the
      <A Href="../book1/alphalast.html#Green">Green Man</A> at the Eye of the
      World.  Unknown to almost everyone (including the Forsaken), Balthamel

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Moiraine">Moiraine Damodred</A>, p.
      166 (201)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah.  Born of a noble House in Cairhien,
      she is <A Href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</A>'s youngest half-sister,
      and King Laman's niece.  She is considered short
      among her people, and the Cairhienin are already a short people.  When it
      was discovered that she had the ability to channel inborn, Moiraine went
      to Tar Valon to become an Aes Sedai.  Just before being raised to the
      shawl, she and her friend <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A> witnessed
      Gitara Moroso's Foretelling of the Rebirth of the
      <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>.  Moiraine and Siuan walked away from each
      other and did not speak to each other again (at least in public), but
      both held secret communication with each other and dedicated their lives
      to finding and guiding the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.  Moiraine
      found the young man she sought on Winternight in Emond's Field, a young
      man named <A Href="#Rand">Rand al'Thor</A>, along with two more
      <I>ta'veren</I>, <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A> and
      <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin Aybara</A> and two women with the spark of the
      Power inborn, <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene al'Vere</A> and
      <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</A>.  When Moiraine was shortly
      raised to the shawl, she met <A Href="#Lan">al'Lan Mandragoran</A>, the
      uncrowned King of Malkier, who was fighting alone against the Shadow in
      the Blight; she asked Lan to become her Warder, and he accepted.  She is
      very strong in the Power, stronger than almost all living Aes Sedai.  In
      the Stone of Tear, Moiraine confronted and killed the Forsaken
      <A Href="#Belal">Be'lal</A> with balefire, just before he would have
      killed Rand.  Later, after having an inkling of the future events from
      the testing <I>ter'angreal</I> for the Wise Ones, Moiraine managed to
      push the Forsaken <A Href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</A> through the twisted
      doorway <I>ter'angreal</I> into the land of the Eelfinn, trapping both
      her and Lanfear there.  It is unknown whether Moiraine lives on in the
      land off the Finn, or whether she is dead, but her bond with Lan has
      been severed, and other Aes Sedai consider her a legend, not only for
      discovering the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A> but for killing or
      trapping two of the Forsaken as well.  <I>See also</I>

      (201)&mdash;One of the Forsaken.  He was born Joar Addam
      Nessosin in the then coastal city of Shorelle, a child prodigy in
      music and art.  He gave his life to the Shadow in exchange for the
      immortality he received, so he could study and perfect his music.  After
      being released from the Bore, he was coerced by
      <A Href="#Lanfear">Lanfear</A> into coming with her, eventually to teach
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A> to channel without killing himself.  Asmodean
      was drawn to Rhuidean and the stash of <I>angreal</I>,
      <I>ter'angreal</I>, and most especially the two white statue
      <I>ter'angreal</I> that linked the holder to the great <I>sa'angreal</I>
      buried near Cairhien and on Tremalking, which together could Break the
      World beyond repair.  He went there to obtain the male statue, but was
      thwarted by Rand, who severed his bonds to the <A Href="#Dark">Dark
      One</A>.  He then became Rand's teacher, and went into hiding from the
      rest of the Chosen, who would kill him on sight if they saw him.  He was
      killed by someone of yet unknown identity right after
      <A Href="#Rahvin">Rahvin</A> and Lanfear were killed/trapped.

      three yellow stars on a blue field.  His banner is a black fox.  He
      rarely smiles, and reminds Mat of a compressed spring.  He commands about
      half of Mat's cavalry in the Band of the Red Hand, and acts as the
      leader of the entire Band in Mat's absence.
  <Li><A Class="name">Shadowman</A>, p. 228 (284)&mdash;The equivalent to
      the boogeyman among children in the World of the Wheel.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Nisao">Nisao Dachen</A>, p. 232
      (288)&mdash;Aes Sedai of the Yellow Ajah.  She agreed to assist
      <A Href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</A> with helping <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>
      because of problems she foresaw with his mind.  Her specialty as a Yellow
      sister is psychiatric problems.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Sarin">Sarin Hoigan</A>, p. 232

      with a thick black beard, he still stands taller than his mistress.

      (288)&mdash;One of <A Href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</A>'s four Warders; he serves as
      one of her husbands, as well.  He is young, skinny, and has blond hair.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Nuhel">Nuhel Dromand</A>, p. 232 (288)&mdash;One
      of <A Href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</A>'s four Warders.  He also serves as a
      husband to her.  He is dark-skinned and bulky with a curly beard with a
      bare upper lip.  He is one of the Warders Myrelle saved; his first
      mistress died.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Lan">al'Lan Mandragoran</A>, p. 233
      (289)&mdash;The uncrowned king of Malkier, and formerly Warder to
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>.  He is quite tall, and doesn't get very
      emotional&mdash;in fact, he has emotional walls all around him that he has
      been building for years.  His country, Malkier, was overrun by Trollocs
      shortly after he was born, and is now corrupted by the Great Blight.
      Lan, the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a one-man war
      against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight.  He fought Aiel
      during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status.  He was eventually
      bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at least changed its
      style).  When Lan and Moiraine brought <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>,
      <A Href="#Mat">Mat</A>, <A Href="#Perrin">Perrin</A>,
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A>, and <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A> out of
      their home in the Two Rivers, he found that there was something which
      could throw his guard down, but he was the last to notice it:  affection
      for Nynaeve.  As Moiraine put it, Nynaeve was able to plant vines in
      Lan's emotional walls and break them down without him even knowing they
      were there.  He loves her very much, whether he admits it openly or not,
      and Nynaeve, to her surprise, loves him in return.  Upon Moiraine's
      death, Lan's bond was immediately transferred to
      <A Href="#Myrelle">Myrelle</A> until Nynaeve is ready to have his bond
      transferred to her.  Myrelle tried to keep Lan's status secret, but she
      was given away when she tried to buy one of Lan's favorite foods, coin
      peppers, too far south (they are very popular in Shienar, and were in
      Malkier before it fell to the Blight, but don't grow well in southern
      climates).  Upon learning of where Lan was,
      <A Href="#Egwene">Egwene</A> sent him to Ebou Dar to serve as a Warder

      was killed when Siuan was deposed; the shock of what
      <A Href="#Elaida">Elaida</A> intended to do masked the usual emotions
      that accompany the death of a Warder for her at first, and when she was
      stilled she lost all contact with the destroyed bond.  However, when she

      was Red Ajah before turning to the Black, but her oath to the Black was
      sworn before even being raised to the Accepted (perhaps before she came

      the object merely makes images of flowers and the sound of a waterfall,
      but it was an object of the Power nonetheless.

      the armies under Luthair have now returned to reclaim the lands of
      Hawkwing's empire in the Old World&mdash;they now call themselves the

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Amathera">Amathera Aelfdene Casmir Lounault</A>,
      p. 433 (555)&mdash;Former Panarch of Tarabon.  She vanished, allegedly at
      Aes Sedai hands, according to White Tower spies.  In reality, Amathera
      was being held prisoner by sisters of the Black Ajah under
      <A Href="#Liandrin">Liandrin</A>, and was rescued by
      <A Href="#Elayne">Elayne</A> and <A Href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve</A>.  They
      had her keep a low profile for several days so as not to be hurt by the
      mob outside the Panarch's Palace (since it is not all that far from
      &quot;The Panarch is dead!&quot; to &quot;Death to the Panarch!&quot;),
      then she returned to her position.  When the Seanchan invaded Tanchico,
      she refused to willingly give her country to the new conquerors; they
      captured her, and forced her to live as a servant.  She now serves as a
      dancer for <A Href="#Suroth">High Lady Suroth</A>, the leader of the
      Seanchan pre-invasionary forces.

      in the city, now called Shadar Logoth (&quot;Where the Shadow
      Waits&quot;) for millenia&mdash;he could not leave the city unless he
      accompanied a person to the city walls or had them carry something from
      the city to the outside world.  Strangely enough, both of these things
      happened at the same time, when <A Href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</A> carried
      the ruby-handled dagger from the city while <A Href="#Fain">Padan
      Fain</A> accompanied Mordeth out of the city at about the same time.
      Mordeth attempted to consume Fain's soul while the dagger tried to
      consume Mat's.  In Fain's case, the attempt to consume his soul was not
      completely successful&mdash;instead, the two souls merged to create something
      more evil than either Mordeth or Fain alone.  Fain now feels incomplete
      without the tainted dagger that was removed from the city.  <I>See
      also</I> <A Href="#Fain">Fain, Padan</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Fain">Padan Fain</A>, p. 554
      (711)&mdash;Former peddler that frequently came to Emond's Field.  A
      Darkfriend, he was given orders to locate the <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon
      Reborn</A> and narrowed it to three boys in Emond's Field.  While
      persuing them, he encountered the spirit of
      <A Href="#Mordeth">Mordeth</A> in Aridhol, now called Shadar Logoth.
      Mordeth attempted to consume Fain's soul, but instead the two souls
      merged, producing something more evil than either of them alone.  Fain
      no longer takes his orders from the Shadow; he has his own evil agenda.
      It is said, &quot;The look of the Eyeless is fear,&quot; from observing
      that a Myrddraal's look causes fear in the hearts of men.  Fain's look
      has that effect on Myrddraal&mdash;Fades feel the same fear of Fain as men
      feel from a Fade.  Fain is also called <A Href="#Ordeith">Ordeith</A>, a
      name he adopted to become a Whitecloak officer.  He is perhaps the most
      evil man alive.  He now serves as advisor to <A Href="#Toram">Toram
      Riatin</A>, one of the Cairhienin nobles in rebellion to
      <A Href="#Rand">Rand</A>.  Rand has a bounty of 100,000 gold crowns on
      his head&mdash;Fain killed Rand's friends because they were his friends, he
      pillaged his homeland because it was his homeland, and Rand intends to
      see him dead for it.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Mordeth">Mordeth</A>;
