<Ul>
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aan"><I>Aan'allein</I></A>, p. 24&mdash;Name the Aiel
      use for <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>.  It means, roughly, &quot;One Man
      Alone&quot; in the Old Tongue.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Adelorna">Adelorna Bastine</A>, p. 124&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Green Ajah.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Adine">Adine Canford</A>, p. 192&mdash;Plump,
      blue-eyed Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah with short-cut black hair.  She
      displays no hint of arrogance despite being raised in Andor.  She is not
      very strong in the One Power.  As Accepted, she was friends with
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> and <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A>, and
      now that they have been raised and have joined the Blue Ajah, that
      friendship has been renewed, thanks especially to their mutual friend,
      <A Href="#Leane">Leane</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aeldra">Aeldra Najaf</A>, p. 119&mdash;Keeper of the
      Chronicles under <A Href="#Tamra">Tamra Ospenya</A>, appointed to
      replace <A Href="#Gitara">Gitara Moroso</A> after her death.  She has
      white, straight hair cut short like <A Href="#Kerene">Kerene</A>'s.
      She is slim, and has copper-colored leathery skin, a narrow jaw, and a
      sharp nose.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aiko">Aiko</A>, p. 305&mdash;Plump, gray-haired
      servant in the Aesdaishar Palace.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Ailene">Ailene Tolvina</A>, p. 295&mdash;Innkeeper of
      The Evening Star, an inn in Chachin where
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> and <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A> stay.
      She is a lean woman with an air that brooks no nonsense.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aisha">Aisha Raveneos</A>, p. 118&mdash;Aes Sedai of
      the Gray Ajah.  <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A> gave her a similar message to
      the one <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> gave
      <A Href="#Karene">Karene</A>.  She has a plain face, and could pass for
      a farmer's wife.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aisling">Aisling Noon</A>, p. 57&mdash;One of the
      Accepted.  She is very tall.  She is a rarity in the Tower, one of the
      Tuatha'an, the Traveling People.  She spent five years as a novice, and
      was raised to Accepted the same year as <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>
      and <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Akarrin">Akarrin</A>, p. 45&mdash;Aes Sedai of the
      Brown Ajah.  She is very slender, and has quick eyes to catch
      <I>anyone</I> who is not following her lead.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Akir">al'Akir Mandragoran</A>, p. 207&mdash;The last
      king of Malkier, <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>'s father.  He died about 24
      years ago when Malkier was overrun, shortly after Lan's birth.
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Lan">Mandragoran, Lan</A>;
      <A Href="#Leanna">Mandragoran, Leanna</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alanna">Alanna Mosvani</A>, p. 59&mdash;One of the
      Accepted.  She is shy, but she works hard at being fierce.  She wants to
      be a Green and have a dozen Warders.  She is always exaggerating.  At
      the meeting where <A Href="#Tamra">Tamra</A> announced her plan for the
      bounty, she asked if the Accepted would be allowed to defend themselves
      with the One Power.  The answer was no.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aldecain">Aldecain Damodred</A>, p. 95&mdash;One of
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>'s uncles, and one of
      <A Href="#Laman">Laman</A>'s brothers.  Moiraine thinks he and his
      brother <A Href="#Moressin">Moressin</A> are even worse than Laman,
      each having heat enough for ten men, which they expressed in anger and
      cruelty, as well as contempt for Moiraine's father.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Laman">Damodred, Laman</A>;
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Damodred, Moiraine</A>;
      <A Href="#Moressin">Damodred, Moressin</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Aledrin">Aledrin</A>, p. 56&mdash;Aes Sedai of the
      White Ajah.  <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> heard her say that
      <I>all</I> Accepted were to test for the shawl immediately at the
      assembly in the Oval Lecture Hall where <A Href="#Tamra">Tamra</A>
      announced her plan to pay bounty.  She is very excitable.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alin">Alin Seroku</A>, p. 207&mdash;Bluff, graying
      officer with white scars on his face.  He soldiered for 40 years along
      the Blight.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Alys">Alys</A>, p.
      223&mdash;<A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>'s alias while traveling, in order
      to conceal her identity.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Amira">Amira</A>, p. 197&mdash;Stocky Aes Sedai of the
      Red Ajah with long beaded braids.  She is the new Mistress of Novices
      under <A Href="#Sierin">Sierin Vayu</A>.  It is tradition to appoint a
      Mistress of Novices from the Ajah one was raised from, but Sierin was
      raised from the Gray while Amira was from the Red.  However, most think
      of Sierin as more Red than Gray anyway.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>, p. 26&mdash;Leader of the
      Aes Sedai, their equivalent of a king or queen.  Her authority is
      immense&mdash;rulers of all nations will obey a summons to the
      Amyrlin, even if they will spend the entire journey devising a plan to
      kill her while there.  The Amyrlin, once raised, is considered to be
      &quot;of all Ajahs and none&quot;&mdash;she wears a stole striped with the
      seven colors of the Ajahs.  The current Amyrlin is
      <A Href="#Tamra">Tamra Ospenya</A>, raised from the Blue Ajah.
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Tamra">Ospenya, Tamra</A>;
      <A Href="#Sierin">Vayu, Sierin</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Anaiya">Anaiya</A>, p. 136&mdash;Aes Sedai of the
      Blue Ajah.  Her plain features make her look more like a farmer than a
      sister.  She was present at <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>'s test for
      the shawl.  She has a comforting air; almost any conversation with her
      turns out comforting.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Andro">Andro</A>, p.
      89&mdash;<A Href="#Meilyn">Meilyn</A>'s Warder.  He is lean, and no taller
      than his mistress.  He appears youthful until one notices his eyes.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Anlee">Anlee</A>, p. 158&mdash;Grave-faced, graying
      Sitter for the Blue Ajah.  She wears lots of jewelry.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Antol">Antol</A>, p.
      308&mdash;<A Href="#Brys">Brys</A>'s eldest son and heir.  He is out of the
      capitol city with <A Href="#Ethenielle">Ethenielle</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Anvaere">Anvaere Damodred</A>, p.
      110&mdash;<A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>'s older sister.  She cares for
      horses, hawking, and little else.  She also has a temper&mdash;no one wants
      her on the Sun Throne.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Innloine">Damodred, Innloine</A>;
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Damodred, Moiraine</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Anya">Anya</A>, p. 279&mdash;Square-faced serving
      woman assigned to <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A> in the Aesdaishar Palace.  She
      has gray hair.  Lan suspects that she is <A Href="#Esne">Esne</A>'s
      mother.
  <Li><A Class="name">Arrow</A>, p. 64&mdash;<A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>'s
      horse.  She purchased her to celebrate being raised to Accepted.  She is
      not tall, though she has more stamina than larger horses.  She is fast,
      too, and a good jumper.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Hawkwing">Artur Hawkwing</A>, p. 15&mdash;Legendary
      emperor who lived about a thousand years ago.  He conquered most of the
      known world, and the present-day nations were carved from his empire.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Asher">Mistress Asher</A>, p. 226&mdash;Gray-haired
      wilder staying in The Gates of Heaven, an inn in Canluum.  A merchant,
      she wears only a red-enameled pin for jewelry.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Atuan">Atuan Larisett</A>, p. 63&mdash;One of the
      Accepted.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Avene">Avene Sahera</A>, p. 231&mdash;Woman on
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>'s list of new mothers.  She is from a
      &quot;village on the high road between Chachin and Canluum,&quot;
      according to what one of the Accepted wrote down; this village turned
      out to be Ravinda.  She is plump, and has graying hair.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Mareed">Azil Mareed</A>, p. 27&mdash;High Captain of
      the Tower Guard.  His reports are available only to Aes Sedai.

<H2><A Name="B">B</A></H2>
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Basram">Basram</A>, p. 12&mdash;Short, stocky,
      coppery-skinned Domani soldier.  <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A> finds him asleep
      at his post during his rounds.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="BiliMandair">Bili Mandair</A>, p.
      108&mdash;<A Href="#WillaMandair">Willa</A>'s infant son.  He was born
      &quot;in sight of Dragonmount,&quot; which is ridiculous; the mountain
      is visible for miles and miles in every direction from Tar Valon.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Brendas">Brendas</A>, p. 29&mdash;One of the Accepted.
      She and <A Href="#Temaile">Temaile</A> were assigned to the
      <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</A>'s chamber before
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> and <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A> took
      over.  She is usually quite sensible.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Brys">Brys</A>, p. 280&mdash;Prince Consort of Kandor.
      By law, he must remain in the city of Chachin if
      <A Href="#Ethenielle">Queen Ethenielle</A> is out of the city, and she
      must remain there if he is abroad.  He is stocky, rough-hewn, and in his
      middle years.  He appears more suited to armor than silks, though he
      wears neither well.  He has a strong reputation as a general, which is
      why he is Prince Consort, Swordbearer, and general of her armies.
      He is solidly built, and has green eyes.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Jarene">Jarene</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Bukama">Bukama Marenellin</A>, p.
      14&mdash;<A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>'s teacher, one of the original 20 men charged
      with the task of carrying the infant prince of Malkier to safety when
      the nation was overrun; he is the only one still alive.  Bluff and
      broad, he is taller than most men, almost as tall as Lan.  His hair is
      solid gray, which he wears cut to the shoulder according to Malkieri
      tradition, held back by the <I>hadori</I>, a thin braided leather cord.
      He has blue eyes.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Bulen">Bulen</A>, p. 279&mdash;Lanky young servant in
      the Aesdaishar Palace in Chachin.  He runs errands for
      <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A> while he is a guest in the palace.

<H2><A Name="C">C</A></H2>
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Cabriana">Cabriana Mecandes</A>, p. 163&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Blue Ajah.  She has pale eyes and light golden hair to her
      waist.  She is very weak in the Power.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Cadsuane">Cadsuane Melaidhrin</A>, p. 228&mdash;Aes
      Sedai of the Green Ajah.  She has iron-gray hair and black eyes, and
      always wears ornaments in her hair.  She is the only woman who Moiraine
      knows that is considerably stronger than Moiraine herself is in the
      Power.  She was presumed dead until she appeared during the Aiel War.
      It is said she bent Tower law whenever it suited her, flouted custom,
      and always did her own thing, often dragging others with her.  It is
      whispered that she even assaulted an <A Href="#Amyrlin">Amyrlin</A>
      once.  <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> knows this cannot be true&mdash;she
      would have been executed&mdash;but she also admits that where her friend
      <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A> was born to lead, Cadsuane was born to
      <I>command</I>.  She is the strongest Aes Sedai in the Tower for the
      past 1000 years.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Cal">Cal</A>, p. 305&mdash;Young footman in the
      Aesdaishar Palace.  <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A>, also known as
      <A Href="#Suki">Suki</A>, plans to use him to find out information about
      the <A Href="#Ines">Lady Ines</A>.  He has pretty brown eyes.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Caniedrin">Caniedrin</A>, p. 19&mdash;Beardless young
      man among <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>'s troops.  The young Kandori is an
      efficient, experienced soldier, and an archer of rare skill.  An almost
      cheerful killer, he often laughs while he fights.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Careme">Careme Mowly</A>, p. 80&mdash;Young mother
      from Murandy.  Her daughter is <A Href="#Sedrin">Sedrin</A>'s age, to
      the day.  Her future husband ran off to become a Warder, and she does
      not like the man she actually <I>did</I> marry nearly as much.  She
      wants very little to do with the White Tower.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Carewin">Carewin Damodred</A>, p.
      173&mdash;<A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>'s great-grandmother.  She ruled
      Cairhien for over fifty years.  The White Tower would call her a very
      successful ruler because Cairhien prospered and had few wars during her
      reign.  However, her name is still used to frighten children in
      Cairhien.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Laman">Damodred, Laman</A>;
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Damodred, Moiraine</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Carlinya">Carlinya</A>, p. 63&mdash;One of the
      Accepted.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Carney">Carney</A>, p. 201&mdash;Captain of
      <I>Bluewing</I>, the ship <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>
      hires to take her out of Tar Valon.
      He is a wide, sun-darkened man with narrow mustaches
      he keeps waxed to spikes.
  <Li><A Class="name">Cat Dancer</A>, p. 19&mdash;<A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>'s bay
      stallion.  He is still being trained as a warhorse.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Ceiline">Ceiline Noreman</A>, p. 221&mdash;Woman from
      Shol Arbela who may blame <A Href="#Ryne">Ryne</A> for her husband's
      death.  Ryne is unwilling to return to Shol Arbela until he is confident
      she will not blame him.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Cetalia">Cetalia Delarme</A>, p. 168&mdash;Aes Sedai
      of the Blue Ajah.  She is as strong as <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>
      and <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A> will be when they reach full potential.
      She is tall and square-faced, with steel-gray hair in a multitude of
      braids to her waist.  She is the head of the Blue Ajah eyes-and-ears,
      the best spy network in the world.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Chesmal">Chesmal Emry</A>, p. 238&mdash;Aes Sedai of
      the Yellow Ajah, a very talented Healer.  She announced that
      <A Href="#Meilyn">Meilyn</A> had died in her bed; this was not
      possible, since <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A> hid under the same bed, fell
      asleep there, and woke up the next morning to find that the bed had not
      been slept in.  She is quite likely of the Black Ajah.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Coladara">Coladara</A>, p. 63&mdash;One of the
      Accepted.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Colar">Colar Najima</A>, p. 222&mdash;Thirteen- or
      fourteen-year-old daughter of <A Href="#Jurine">Jurine</A>.  She and her
      sister <A Href="#Eselle">Eselle</A> have their mother's long black hair
      and large blue eyes full of loss.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Cormanes">Cormanes</A>, p. 315&mdash;Last man
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> ever kissed.  That was the night before
      she left for the White Tower.  She describes him as
      &quot;beautiful.&quot;
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Coy">Coy</A>, p. 266&mdash;Leader of the bandits that
      try to mug <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>, <A Href="#Lan">Lan</A>,

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Creator">The Creator</A>, p. 15&mdash;Maker of the
      world, the True Source, everything in existance.  At the moment of
      Creation, the Creator sealed the <A Href="#Dark">Dark One</A> in a
      prison at Shayol Ghul to keep him from influencing the world.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="CyrilWynn">Cyril Wynn</A>, p.
      82&mdash;<A Href="#Susa">Susa</A>'s son.  He is too old to receive the bounty
      the White Tower is paying for newborns in honor of the battle, but
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> added him to the list anyway&mdash;she
      reasoned that the Tower could provide 100 crowns to help the
      misfortunate.  <I>See also</I> <A Href="#SusaWynn">Wynn, Susa</A>.

<H2><A Name="D">D</A></H2>
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Danil">Danil</A>, p. 83&mdash;Baby boy registered by
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>.  His mother tried to play Moiraine for
      a fool, coaxing money from her for a healer.  Moiraine quickly disabused
      her of that notion, and at the same time got rid of any other potential
      rookery by the women in the line.
  <Li><A Class="name">Dark One</A>, p. 12&mdash;Name, used in every land, for
      <A Href="#Dark">Shai'tan</A>, because using his real name causes bad
      luck (at best) to anyone who speaks it.  <I>See</I>
      <A Href="#Dark">Shai'tan</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Desandre">Desandre</A>, p. 63&mdash;One of the
      Accepted.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Diryk">Diryk</A>, p.
      283&mdash;<A Href="#Brys">Brys</A>'s second son, eight years old.  He fell
      fifty feet from a balcony and broke nothing.  He is handsome, with dark
      eyes.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Dragon">The Dragon</A>, p. 36&mdash;Name by which Lews
      Therin Telamon was known during the War of the Shadow. His Rebirth
      will signal Tarmon Gaidon, the Last Battle against the Shadow.  This
      Rebirth was Foretold by <A Href="#Gitara">Gitara Moroso</A>, just before
      the moment of her death.  <I>See also</I>
      <A Href="#Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Reborn">Dragon Reborn</A>, p. 43&mdash;According to
      the Karaethon Cycle, the Prophecies of the Dragon, the man who is the
      Rebirth of Lews Therin Telamon, the <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>.  It is
      said he will be Reborn at mankind's greatest hour of need to save the
      world. His Rebirth was Foretold by Gitara Moroso just before her death;
      in fact, the shock of the Foretelling was what killed her.
      <I>See also</I> <A Href="#Dragon">Dragon</A>.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Duhara">Duhara Basaheen</A>, p. 197&mdash;Aes Sedai
      of the Red
      Ajah from Arad Doman.  Slim and beautiful despite being a hand and a
      half taller than <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>.  Her full lips have
      a meanness about them, and her eyes search for fault.  She is much
      weaker than <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> in the One Power, but now

      <A Href="#Sierin">Sierin Vayu</A>, that matters little.  It is tradition
      to appoint a Keeper from the Ajah one was raised from, but Sierin was
      raised from the Gray while Duhara was from the Red.  However, most think
      of Sierin as more Red than Gray anyway.

      smiles.  Waves of golden hair frame her nearly perfect face, her eyes
      look like large sapphires, and her skin is a rich creamy color.  The

      given four gifts (while still in his cradle): a gold signet ring, a
      locket, a sword, and an oath. Lan and his surviving Malkieri companions
      are the last of their people. He prefers to avoid Aes Sedai when
      possible.  Lan has experience fighting the Aiel on the
      Shienaran Marches, long before the Aiel War even began.  He is quite

  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Laras">Laras</A>, p. 104&mdash;Tower cook.  She is

      She is gregarious and mercurial, with a boisterous sense of humor and
      a worse temper than Moiraine.  Moiraine and Myrelle began novice
      training with heated words, but they eventually became close friends.

      soldier.  He has a hoarse voice and a ragged scar from an Aiel arrow to

      complete antithesis of the <A Href="#Creator">Creator</A> in every way.
      He was imprisoned by the Creator at the moment of Creation in a prison
      just outside the Pattern.  This prison was bored into during the Age of
      Legends; the Dark One's touch on the world produced new waves of hate,
      crime, and violence that had never been seen before.  An attempt to free
      the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow, a war which
      ended only with the sealing of the Bore by <A Href="#Lews">Lews Therin
      Telamon</A> and the Hundred Companions.  During the moment of sealing,
      the Dark One's counterstroke tainted <I>saidin</I> itself, beginning the
      Time of Madness.  The seals on the prison were made of <I>cuendillar</I>,
      and indestructible substance, but nonetheless are beginning to weaken.
      The Dark One may touch the world again soon.  Speaking his true name
      draws his attention and causes bad luck, so he is known by a plethora of
      euphemisms, most commonly as simply, &quot;The Dark One.&quot;  Some,
      including <A Href="#Bukama">Bukama</A>, believe that merely
      <I>thinking</I> his true name is enough.

      with tilted green eyes.  She grew up in Saldaea.
      She is a very good cook, and likes baking.
      One of the biggest gossips among the Accepted, it is wise to keep a
      careful tongue around her.  She sleeps like the dead.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Shivena">Shivena Kayenzi</A>, p. 122&mdash;Philosopher
      from Saldaea.  She was influenced by the work of
      <A Href="#Willim">Willim of Manaches</A>.  <A Href="#Meilyn">Meilyn</A>

      death of <A Href="#Tamra">Tamra Ospenya</A>, who allegedly died in her
      sleep.  Traditionally, a newly raised Amyrlin grants indulgences and
      relief from penances on the day she is raised; Sierin granted none, and
      dismissed all male clerks in the Tower within a week, for various vague
      reasons.  Three sisters were exiled from Tar Valon for a year, and two
      were stripped, stretched on the triangle, and birched in the Traitor's
      Court.  She is quite plump, and has a round face that seems constructed
      for jolliness, but she wears grimness as though it were carved there.
      She is slightly taller than <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A>, and has
      hard eyes.  She is merciless.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Silene">Silene Dorelmin</A>, p. 302&mdash;Best

      haughty hair and a cool voice.
  <Li><A Class="name" Name="Siuan">Siuan Sanche</A>, p. 26&mdash;One of the
      Accepted.  She grew up on a fishing boat in Tear, and was sent on the
      first boat bound for Tar Valon the day it was discovered she had the
      spark of <I>saidar</I> inborn, in accordance with Tairen law.  Her
      parents are now dead, her mother dying when she was very young.  Upon
      arriving at the Tower, she very quickly became friends with
      <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine Damodred</A>, and despite the large gap
      between their incomes and lifestyles as children, they found they had a
      remarkable amount in common.  The two moved at nearly the same rate
      through their work with the Power, but Siuan seems to learn things like
      history, language, and politics at a much faster rate.  In fact, she
      arrived at the Tower barely able to read, and now she teaches
      introductory classes in the Old Tongue.  She has very fair skin, clear
      blue eyes, and is only a hand taller than Moiraine.  She has a talent
      for puzzles.  Like Moiraine, she will someday become one of the
      strongest Aes Sedai in the Tower.  <I>See also</I>

      She was raised from the Blue Ajah.  She is always fair and just, which

      gained the great serpent ring one year before <A Href="#Siuan">Siuan</A>
      and <A Href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</A> did.  She had few friends as a
