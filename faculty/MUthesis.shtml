<h1>The <span class="sans">MUthesis</span> Document Class</h1>
<p>I wrote a <span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
document class, <span class="sans">MUthesis</span>,
that implements the
<a href="https://gradschool.missouri.edu/current-students/thesis-dissertation/thesis-dissertation-guidelines/">formatting
requirements for theses and dissertations at the University of Missouri</a>.
The class is based on the standard <span class="sans">report</span> class.
</p>

<p>As with most document classes, you should start with the bare minimum of
packages and <b>only load a package if you know you need it</b>. This class is
designed for theses and dissertations, which are one-sided documents. However,
it also handles comprehensive examinations and handles two-sided printing for
personal use and/or for preliminary drafts. Note that two-sided documents would
not be acceptable to the Graduate School as a final copy.</p>

<p>The current version is <b>1.10</b>. If you are using an older version, you
are strongly advised to upgrade.</p>

<h2>Getting and Using <span class="sans">MUthesis</span></h2>
<p>You will need two files:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a download href="MUthesis/MUthesis.dtx">MUthesis.dtx</a></dt>
    <dd>The documentation and implementation file. This is the file that
        actually defines the class.</dd>
  <dt><a download href="MUthesis/MUthesis.ins">MUthesis.ins</a></dt>
    <dd>The installation file. This tells
        <span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
        how to extract the class file and example from the .dtx file.
    </dd>
</dl>
If you use <span class="latex">T<sub>e</sub>XLIVE</span> (which is common),
you have two options for where to put these files [do ONE of these two]:
<ol>
  <li>Download both files into <kbd>$HOME/texmf/</kbd>[<var>some
    subdirectory</var>]<kbd>/MUthesis</kbd>
  <li>Assuming the directory you just downloaded files into is called
    <kbd>$HOME/foo/MUthesis</kbd>, add something like the following line to
    your shell's startup file (I have assumed it is <kbd>$HOME/.bashrc</kbd>
    or <kbd>$HOME/.zshrc</kbd>):<br>
    <kbd>export TEXINPUTS=".:$HOME/foo/MUthesis:"</kbd>
</ol>
Now perform the following commands in a shell whose working directory is where
you saved the two files to unpack the class and documentation:
<ol>
  <li><kbd>pdflatex MUthesis.ins</kbd> (running <kbd>latex</kbd> also works)
<br>
    <i>if you only want the class and do not want to build
    <a href="MUthesis/MUthesis.pdf">the documentation</a>,
    you may skip to the last step</i>
  </li>
  <li><kbd>pdflatex MUthesis.dtx</kbd></li>
  <li><kbd>makeindex -s gglo.ist -o MUthesis.gls MUthesis.glo</kbd></li>
  <li><kbd>makeindex -s gind.ist -o MUthesis.ind MUthesis.idx</kbd></li>
  <li><kbd>pdflatex MUthesis.dtx</kbd></li>
  <li><kbd>pdflatex MUthesis.dtx</kbd></li>
  <li><kbd>texhash $HOME/texmf</kbd>
    <br>
    <i>This last step is only necessary if you put the files in a subdirectory
    of <kbd>$HOME/texmf</kbd>; if you are using the TEXINPUTS environment
    variable, skip the last step.</i>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Known Issues and Reporting Problems</h2>
<p>
Be sure to read
    <a href="MUthesis/MUthesis.pdf">the documentation</a>
before asking questions about functionality. Please also read the
&ldquo;Known Issues&rdquo; section of the documentation as well as the
&ldquo;Compatibility with Standard Packages&rdquo; section.

<p>Good luck!</p>
