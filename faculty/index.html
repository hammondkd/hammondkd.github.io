<h1>Welcome</h1>
<div class="float_right"><img src="images/SFH.jpg" alt="SFH"></div>
<p>
The Hammond research group uses a combination of computational modeling and
experimental characterization to study materials that have energy applications.
This includes adsorption, transport, separations, and catalysis using
zeolite-like materials for both &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; and
&ldquo;renewable&rdquo; fuels (such as biomass-derived molecules) as well as
radiation damage to materials in nuclear reactors (some in fission reactors,
but primarily in experimental fusion reactors and plasma devices).
</p>

<p>
Our primary aim is to use computational techniques in tandem with experiments
to achieve a better understanding of the underlying physical and chemical
processes involved. This might mean direct investigation of a reaction or
diffusion mechanism, or it may involve a series of calculations that, when
viewed as a whole, paint a picture of the process from the atomic scale all the
way up to entire device.
</p>

<p>
One inspiring aspect of computational materials science and catalysis
research is an atomic-scale understanding of physical and chemical processes
that is impossible using purely experimental means.  Simulations also provide
feedback as to what the next set of experiments should be; similarly, that set
of experiments often provides a direction for the next set of simulations, and
so on.
