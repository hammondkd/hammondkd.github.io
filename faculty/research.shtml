<h1>Research</h1>
<p>My group conducts research in materials for nuclear energy, 
catalysis, adsorption, and other energy-related applications. Particular focus
is given to simulation of materials for plasma-facing environments, including
nuclear fusion reactors; transport and radiation damage in materials, including
simulations of nuclear fission reactor fuels; catalytic and adsorption
processes in zeolites and other porous materials; characterization of
materials; and modeling and simulation of porous materials.</p>

<h2>Plasma-Facing Materials</h2>

<p>Nuclear fusion is the ultimate source of nearly all energy we utilize today.
Unfortunately, the best reactors to produce energy from nuclear fusion are,
well, a little bulky. The nearest one to us, for example, has a mass of almost
2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;kg and produces 400&nbsp;YW
(4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;W)
of power (you might know it as the Sun).
Clearly, this gravitationally confined environment is not feasible on Earth, so
we have had to get more clever.</p>

<p>Instead, humans have envisioned inertial confinement reactors, in which
high-power lasers focus onto a very small sample, instantaneously compressing
it and starting fusion reactions. Inertial confinement is the basis of the
National Ignition Facility in California (pictured at left). Unfortunately,
this type of reactor (like all others) has many hurdles to overcome as
well.</p>

<p>The third option devised to date is magnetically confined fusion, which is
the basis for <a href="http://iter.org/">ITER</a>, a test reactor under
construction near Cadarache, France. ITER is the culmination of around
50&nbsp;years of plasma physics research, and is expected to be the first
terrestrial fusion reactor to produce more power than is required to heat the
plasma for longer than a few seconds. However, the conditions of the plasma in
ITER and future magnetic confinement devices are becoming increasingly hostile
to the materials from which the device is constructed. These materials
challenges may come to dominate research in fusion during the coming years, as
we strive to achieve the dream of a terrestrial nuclear fusion reactor.</p>

<p>Recent work in plasma-facing materials has revealed that helium, the 
product of nuclear fusion, creates many unexpected and/or detrimental 
phenomena when implanted in metals due to helium plasma exposure. Helium
bubbles, in particular, are possible sources of increased hydrogen 
(specifically tritium) retention, as well as plasma contamination by the
divertor material (tungsten). Our work comes in at the microscopic 
level: we examine the transport processes involved in hydrogen, helium, 
lithium, and beryllium transport inside the divertor and first wall of 
the reactor, as well as smaller plasma devices intended as model systems for
ITER and other future reactors. Specifically, we wish to determine the
interplay between the various reactor materials as they sputter and redeposit
on other surfaces, changing the surface and diffusion properties within the
metal.</p>

<h2>Nuclear Materials</h2>
<p>While nuclear fusion holds great promise, it is, at present, 
impractical as a source of energy for our everyday use.  Nuclear 
fission, on the other hand, provides approximately 20% of electrical 
energy in the United States and represents approximately 8% of our total
 energy use annually.  Nuclear reactors have the distinct advantage 
that, once built, they are extremely cheap to operate, and they have 
excellent safety records: in the USA, accidents at nuclear power 
facilities have claimed just three miltary and zero civilian
lives&mdash;ever. In fact, fission power causes fewer deaths per unit of
electricity than all other power sources worldwide, and most of those deaths
are those of miners and deaths in isolated incidents such as Chernobyl.</p>

<p>Nuclear reactors, much like cell phone data plans, are generally 
divided into &ldquo;generations,&rdquo; such as &ldquo;Generation III
reactors.&rdquo; A big part of the progress in nuclear energy is our improved
understanding of nuclear reactor physics, particularly how the reactor behaves
during disruptions from steady-state in terms of power output and radiation
production.  Nuclear reactor materials, which include fuel, cladding, and
structural materials, are susceptible to damage both from neutrons and the
resulting hydrogen they decay into, as well as fission gas production (xenon,
krypton) from the fission process and radioactive decay of fission products to
produce high-energy electrons (beta particles) and helium nuclei (alpha
particles).</p>

<p>My group&lsquo;s work in this area, previously supported by a Faculty
Development Grant from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, uses the tools of
computational materials science and applied physics to model heat and mass
transfer processes in nuclear materials, particularly radiation effects and
thermal transient phenomena. We also study the thermodynamics and materials
physics of alternative nuclear fuels such as metallic uranium&ndash;molybdenum
alloys.  Our work is in tandem with the <a
href="http://murr.missouri.edu/">Missouri University Research Reactor</a>
(MURR), the largest academic research reactor in the country.</p>

<h2>Zeolites and Similar Porous and Catalytic Materials</h2>

<p>Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates that revolutionized the
petrochemicals industry when they were introduced into the cracking and
refining processes decades ago. The key to this revolution was the small pores
zeolites possess: the constrained environment of a zeolite pore either prevents
large molecules (e.g., asphalt-range hydrocarbons) from forming, or prevents
their diffusion out of the zeolite before they react again.</p>

<p>Zeolite-catalyzed processes typically involve acid sites, another prominent
feature of zeolite chemistry: the aluminum atoms, which have trivalent
chemistry, create a net negative charge when in the tetravalent sites normally
occupied by silicon atoms. This negative formal charge creates a Lewis base
site near each aluminum atom. If the compensating cation is hydrogen, the
zeolite has net Br&oslash;nsted acidity.  Most zeolites, especially
low-aluminum zeolites, are strong acids, making them fairly potent acid
catalysts capable of doing size-selective chemistry.</p>

<p>My group&rsquo;s primary research in zeolites is in their spectroscopic 
properties.  Specifically, we want to be able to predict&ndash;quickly and 
accurately&ndash;the infrared spectrum of a zeolite using nothing but
computational tools.  Sounds simple, right?  Except that the vibrations are
tightly coupled, the crystals are <i>huge</i> (as simulations go, at least),
and the models we have&hellip;well&hellip;stink.  As such, we proceed along 
all of these fronts, doing DFT-based calculations of periodic structures as a
baseline, comparing those to simulations of finite, molecule-like portions of
zeolite crystals, and comparing both sets of calculations to faster, though
typically less-accurate, models of zeolite vibration.</p>

<p>Another avenue of research in my group is zeolites that have been modified
to act as Br&oslash;nsted <i>bases</i>.
Our goal is to find the right combination of crystal structure and 
Si/Al ratio, combined with treatment procedure and catalytic reaction 
conditions, which will make nitrided zeolite catalysis a reality. This 
research is directed toward oxygenated molecules, which are often 
upgraded by way of base-catalyzed reactions.</p>

<p>A typical starting point for these materials is treatment of a zeolite 
with high-temperature ammonia or other amine-generating agents. This
process substitutes some of the oxygen for NH groups, which act as 
Br&oslash;nsted (and Lewis) bases. Our challenge as we move forward is to find
a viable combination of catalyst stability, reactant/product species, and
reaction pathway characteristics that make alkaline zeolite catalysis a
reality.</p>
